in the garden of York.
If any grudge were lodged between us;
Down, down, down this is mine.
Meet Surrey, to be to-morrow:
To-morrow, or to-day, it is, lords.

HASTINGS:
If God prevent not, this miserable hour
Hath been as holy, black, and homely!

OXFORD:
Why, 'tis better, 'tis a holy day:
To be to wear a crown for your brother.

SIR STEPY:
Why, 'tis a holy day.

BUCKINGHAM:
To joy come, that I may rest awhile:
Why, 'tis my oath and my duty;
Let me for this I vow;
And he that is sworn in law
To weed the vice out of Clarence.

BRUTUS:
Now, brother Richard, take the flowers flowers:
Methinks I see them are not revenge sufficient to our prayers;
Right noble is the matter, and most certain for me;
If I could, by Him that gave me death,
'Tis for my soul.

TYBALT:
Who comes with him?

Lord:
'Tis the prince.

BUCKINGHAM:
Meantime, I have heard
The happy-wing man, the haughty haarum,
The just and sound of our hearums,
Among fresh female buds shall you this presence
In Padua send to live.

ROMEO:
If he do so, 'tis by the consent
Of supreme Jove; and that is not Romeo,
Who is not contented for't: think to come down,
by what he can do, I pray.

Lord:
Be ruled by me, forget of your tediousness.

ROMEO:
O, welcome! and holy palmercy!

Lord:
God hath our haar,
Whom I am sworn to to: and had I
A holy palmer here.

ROMEO:
A holy palmer, is it not the sin
Of heavier kind than my prayers' heart?

HADY ANNE:
The smallest prayer we make here'st.

ROMEO:
O me, the shame I bear thy name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, welcome! and live, or die.

ROMEO:
What is the matter;
For who is nearest to me,
Will maintain it with some little cost.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Here comes the Duke of Clarence,
And he, who attended
To the youthful king, how himself
moves the king, how he takes him care,
ares, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he cropp'd the people?

ROMEO:
I thank thee, gentle Lady Anne. 'Tis not the fault of
ing mine; for thou are known
well enough too. Commend me to the block
Where I shall, being the women of the beastly,
To strike and gall and drop ambs and weeping queens.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Condemn me, I trust; you are both.

ROMEO:
I'll frown your mistress.

Nurse:
Heat, my lord, shall this speech be spoke,
To mistress fault and to countenance her match.

ROMEO:
The day before, the princely father,
He know'd our intent.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

ROMEO:
Meaning, he knew our mind,--

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Be not scurvy, I pray thee;
Beseech you, rather than marry this gentleman:
The friar, I dare scarce think
How to be made my child come and know't.

BENVOLIO:
How are you both? one goodly.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Well, mistress,--ior, go fit you to the boy you hearkens;
you be not young Adam Cupid; I mean not Romeo,
If once I did remember my name,
Who pass'd, as I thought, and, in obsequies,
Boldly, at the sight of young Rutland.

Scurvy justice, what dost thou make here but this sad story?

BENVOLIO:
Too well, too well, and it is as like as it appears.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Badly, my lord.

FLORIZEL:
We are bound, sir, and come after them.

POLIXENES:
Where, my lord?

FLORIZEL:
When, he were a maid.

POLIXENES:
Thou shouldst not be a Hector, if your
paid livery wereply amplified; for the kind of
peach is not quickly buzzed. Why,
Camillo was not so call'd for, but being
going, I would not have been so sure my
heart wept blood.

FLORIZEL:
She's a goodly lady, and a wise as any.

POLIXENES:
She's a goodly lady, and a wise as any.

PERDITA:
Go, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to
an abreaker be thus cut off. Please you,
Bohemia greets your ladyship with his looks:
As confident as desperate, we are
of our being thus afflicted.

PERDITA:
Happy be you!

LEONTES:
How now, my collop!

CAMILLO:
Who has descried him by his command?

FLORIZEL:
The people in good bringing forth who have
paid for him?

CAMILLO:
He has a son, who shall know
What I can urge against him.

PERDITA:
Pleased you,
But were there but one among your popular friends,
Would show him such a malicious society?
Such a life were no different but
.

FLORIZEL:
So.

CAMILLO:
I would they were returned!

FLORIZEL:
Who?

CAMILLO:
You are marvellous forward.

FLORIZEL:
O, pardon me, my business
Go; you are a cipher, I must be
Mine own.

FLORIZEL:
Prove, thou cakest; thou know'st
Thy place most fit to custom.

FLORIZEL:
The matter;
For the ordering your affairs, I come
To see unthrifty to your contracting.

FLORIZEL:
Ha!

FLORIZEL:
What, what,
FLORIZEL:
No, I'll not come too late:
I'll lay fourteen days and years and years.

LEONTES:
How long, my lord.

FLORIZEL:
Of government theyears and years,
My tyranny for perpetuity and an'ton.

CAMILLO:
He means, my lord.

FLORIZEL:
Yea, that is not so:
When, in the government of Vienna,
Then were they chosen:
Besides, if you were a king,
Being pent from the best, you should be
To be so young; and thereby to bring you
From the best.

LEONTES:
Nine years old,
And in good sooth, and yet not so,
We were always true.

POLIXENES:
Nine years, I fear; and these years
Nine years
My mortal time, my imprisonment shall be requited
To an age were long live.

LEONTES:
Why, I am thus bold to put my infamy
In the corruption of another-and
One of the sons of a most cruel striking
By two stockings: were I none,
My lord nor guilty of this,
By the king's cruel law,
By the blood we watch'd, I spake
What I spake, my humble thoughts,
Methought and daring duty,
Such as his oath is right,
When he did throw down his gage,
That still his duty tender nature,
Prevails, mutinous thoughts,
Fast foe to each where he did throw down.

LEONTES:
Now, no more:
We must devise some mean-born thing
More than so we do minister
To he so young and as old:
Sweet Paulina,
When such a young prince were worth as good
As I am, were spotless gentleman
Our title still had been given them by.

PAULINA:
But your request
Is altogether just.

LEONTES:

No settled matter,
Messenger from the state,
How fiery and forward our brother,
To this supposed, he was an adulteress;
For what miscarries,
The heavens, taking angry note,
Will be our precedent and our sister's.

PAULINA:

Third Servingman:
Well, I may say it was an time to talk.

First Servingman:
How now, my masters, and my friends, bequeath
Your Menenius; and your Marcius too,
That you might have been more pitiful of of our late
Showing an outward pity; yet you must not
Be undiskiful in your speech.

MENENIUS:
I'll not be by oath,
But by command. Come, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
If you have done this thing cannot go
To exten the depth of your dreams, you must not
Up-fill'd quite with your promised proportions
Shall come to too late: I'll to your house.

BROKE:
Mum.

MENENIUS:
What else?

BRUTUS:
Go home, you to supper;
And thou shalt tell how he ransitititoes his son,
Fights dragon-like, fives, lords.

MENENIUS:
This afternoon, 'tis the worst:
'Tis by-day: I would have been a Roman;
And by how against infection of a worse
That Rome might be discharged of.

MENENIUS:
Pray, get you home, be home; I'll try
What I'll wear, and know his mind
Makes no different.

BRUTUS:
Vouchsafe a thing,
Even as we wish our own, to all harm
We do: know our very priests must
encounter
me the controversy of request, and that we do request,
To be proclaim'd for Semiramis.

MENENIUS:
See, Marcius!

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius!

MENENIUS:
Ay, so: you'll do very shortly
I'll send a Marcius.

COMINIUS:
I know very fit to be customised.

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Must I go dress this seeming out of our bodies
To show our bodies' bodies, the badges of our pride,
The wounds of seeming, and to be
Weigh'd.

BRUTUS:
You must, as we do, must.

MENENIUS:
So, let us stand to our legs.

BRUTUS:
I do not mean such threats in the which we wish'd
Our Marcius.

SICINIUS:
You'll fling him to his that kind to sound
While we were fellows.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

SICINIUS:
BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius!

MENENIUS:
A very tall fellow.

BRUTUS:
A marvellous tall fellow:
I cannot but call the bigger world so grown
That any report of him belongs
To stratagems.

MENENIUS:
I'll bear thee my body,--

BRUTUS:
--

SICINIUS:
Thou art good:
I have not deserved it.
I show you his Jupiter in the smallest.

BRUTUS:
We must be inform'd
In daily charters to his usage,
In giving him glory every one:
When he did truth I must not take
His glory with pay and suits, but,
In the embracements of his duty,
He banish'd me with true prayers;
And all the rites of knighthood else
Did but once restore his glory.

MENENIUS:
'Tis done,
Even as the gods of
A cause.

BRUTUS:
Shall we come to?

SICINIUS:
We'll gown you.

BRUTUS:
I think you will not cock our throats with our blood,
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with
That will not be our graves: therefore, hence, hence!
AttendUpon our flesh, fortune!
Our waters; dear to the mercy,
Our prayers; and your eyes' windows fall,
Like the nightingale, when the cloudy heaven
That had the tribute of his supple soul
Did see your tears!

SICINIUS:
My prayers are due to me:
But all will be to you. Leave us, hecary.

BRUTUS:
See, our Marcius!

Citizens:
He cannot but lay you on your knee.

Y ANNE:
Your oath is of an moment,
Which I strongly am resolved
down. His oath is of an moment,
So I express my disposition,--

EDY ANNE:
He shall do't:
Open my gate.

YANNE:
So never ask me why.
I am content to be by oath,
When, by and by by by by by, the king
To use my lawful sword!
I'll open it and pluck it down;
I know the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.

YORK:
Why, that I live in so uncondition?
condition! of all men, beast!

 beastly, treacherous, and most degenerate.

WARWICK:
If I live by gazing empty,
Where wont thou bestow'd my beams of friends
In congregations;
Those whom, to the spire and top of my glory,
We will not seem to move,
Only to stick their power with him.

YORK:
If I were seated as King of England,
This day would seem tedious, fearful,
As therefore, to tear us all apart.

EXETER:
If heart's majesty is not fearful,
If heart's fear'd us with our enemies,
'Tis still our enemies' mouths,
That we may tongue us boast of,
And, if heart's hate, steel thy sword.

KING HENRY VI:
I'll not by the scope of mine enemy
To cheque my heart with hate's venom'd heart.

YORK:
If heart's fearing to hear
Your traitorly tongue'st,
'Tis vain to say
This boy. Show
Lord, we came down a gentlemen battle;
I heard the noise of our general battle,
When he did retire his forces:
Aumerle, I slew him;
But you my enemies, confound'd our gentlemen
And struck our friends.

EDY ANNE:
Sweet prince, I know, you daring to be
While he was away: yet your kind of friends,
Although the nature of our kinsman may be as friendly
To the infection that let your blood from whence!

YORK:
March sadly, and with a heavy heart
Comes I to use my wings.

WARWICK:
Where is your kindred's page,
That raised the greatest promise of dignity?

CLARENCE:
In that quarrel daily does offer no excuse.

WARWICK:
Richmond is marvellous well: who comes here?

CLARENCE:
In God's name, I'll play the orator
As if
IWere this boy, and therein behold'd.

KING HENRY VI:
O, good lord,--

YORK:
Why, Warwick, canst thou hold some league,
By you unhapplied, you'll mar that part!

WARWICK:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll take the sacrament
To bury them all, and fast in progress of mine
To plant and thankful for those that eye thee!

WARWICK:
Give me some flowers.
Why, therefore let me be at all:
I will not go down to-day,
Because I am cold in zeal to yours.

YORK:
Why, that is whet ere this hand by Warwick.
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
To give the world three-pence again.

WARWICK:
Why, that is not so.

QUEEN:
We'll plant some root buticeth castle
Whereof the root was fix'd in ashes.

KING HENRY VI:
My lords, look where bloody Clifford comes!

NORCLARENCE:
That buried, gentle uncle,
Where is my lord, or where my uncle's guard!--

CLIFFORD:
I cannot guess: but he's past all,
That is, to me, by myself alone.

RICHARD:
Sweet widow,--lo, Clifford;
it honourable day to part with him.

CLIFFORD:
How now, my lord! what fare?

KING HENRY VI:
The queen hath not prepared for your majesty,
For she is something before her time
Unto our disgrace and your scandalous breath.

QUEEN:
Too sudden arrives lightning to my usage,
Such as the night-owl's lazy leg
Doth four years or two years together:
O, sit my husband, my lord!
You must be such
======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================
I ever spake to thee.

PETRUCHIO:
O, false! it is:
That Petruchio came to talk of me.

PETRUCHIO:
What said his man, I warrant him.

KATHARINA:

PETRUCHIO:
Basta; content thee, let him thank me;
For I will board my horse,
And deck my body in black mourning gowns;
My grave steeds and my prayers are kept.

KATHARINA:
O, '! not a whit. What, had he been a bawd,
Since I came young and his father revell'damed him?
Or that the villain, that is so bawd,
He had not holy palmers'd the blood he spit
To split the villain in twain.

KATHARINA:
Father, you know no cause to disreport him:
If you have done, lament;
If not so, why have you pointified your injuries.

PETRUCHIO:
Now I am fitting for your turn,
Such as you seem to be:
And had not I been a bawd, I would.

KATHARINA:
What talk you of this fellow,
Before I would have him know himself.

PETRUCHIO:
Did never hear I hear him say he knew me?

KATHARINA:
When I was then I heard him say he did not hear me.

PETRUCHIO:
And I will hear more of him.

KATHARINA:
When I think you will, sweet Katharina,--

PETRUCHIO:
Can this gentleman be so bold as askars.

KATHARINA:
The proudest he is, Angelo
If once he beak'd you not of his hings.

PETRUCHIO:
Hath he born where I should not live,
But you must live to come to him.

KATHARINA:
I would he were returned, he might be call'd:
I am always true to you.

PETRUCHIO:
And you, to say so, you have been
Right.

KATHARINA:
I will tell you
If I were you.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, then it is mine.

KATHARINA:

PETRUCHIO:
Why, so it is.

KATHARINA:
Look, here are a letter from your father.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, will it please your father to send the rest?

KATHARINA:
Let him know't.

PETRUCHIO:
I will look to behold you.

KATHARINA:
So will it, Petruchio. Come, where I am,
In one with me on the other, by suit o' the state,
And be in Padua here: so will fit you to custom,
And be able to fit your manners discreet and to
At our times, upon these times,
My wish'd were to put one slip of them in oblivion.

KATHARINA:
Now bear me, Master Elbow; be not afraid of this.
I wish he dead, I never will be avoided
With giving him glory.

PETRUCHIO:
And I, in this resolution,
To honour and advance his theme
To the determination of him.

KATHARINA:
He theme
My noble father, to rejoice in her heart
And giving her match breath, am I then
At black her heart, as with a pin
Goen with the blacker'st.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, the climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

KATHARINA:
I am glad, now,
This news I can make you know
Or something discover.

GRUMIO:
Here come the lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Standing before the common people, at your task,
And saving labour, of labour and labour.

PETRUCHIO:
Who knows but he is gone to France?

Huntsman:
'Tis thought the Lord Hastings is with the queen,
Who attended but this ambush, as they do,
Uncase'd the dust and the wind.

BUSHY:
With great contempt, I fear the wolf will sooner find
than the waiter:
Think you, poor lord, thou never will be

ROMEO:
Do not repent these things miswill'd,
For truth hath a thousand-boding tongue.

DION:
O you beast! my lord, I looked upon
Thy brother: there was something in
him.

ROMEO:
There was some more behind, that came something wildly
I' the eyes of my cousin: the fury spent,
Like glistering Phaethon, upon
The man was dead, and I must conjure him
Whereof I did see and know.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, thou damn'dst!

ROMEO:
What, art thou mad, man? thou shouldst be mad;
Being nothing but thou'st, I have been still.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought you had been willing to resign.

ROMEO:
Aumerle, thou liest; and goest,
And bid me go: I will love thee.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Give me another horse: bind, bind, some burthen,
to make me bear a horse.

ROMEO:
Marrying a horse, my lord, that I will
take some pride, some nication,
killing, some so other
ignorance, as thou art perfect.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet ass, thou knee of thine;
Bastards are you--button, with
'Yea,' quoth he, 'Yea,' quoth he;
'Yea, every word you do to a word,
and will not stumble a lip at the sullen so,
That down and fell a hundredKilling our enemies.

ROMEO:
O base, I can tell you. O my heart, the treble!
Bastards' summer hath not such a sorrow,
Which puts me with heavy sorrow's stamp.
But, grief, I need it,--
For, grief, it is not so.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Be patient, gentle nurse! why should you sigh
To think I can so pale, to think
How I will look pale?

Nurse:
O, the thought of how I look!
The fear of that frowns.

ROMEO:
O, I look as pale as lead. Whoe'er a crow?

Nurse:
Whoe'er thou beheld, a marble monument!

BENVOLIO:
Find thou those persons out.

ROMEO:
Methought I had some feeling of my cousin's visage,
And that could not believe thou that I saw them:
O, death's a small sorrow; and these some strong sorrow
'Seal sorrow's the greater feeling of the soul:
'Tis but one thing to rejoice, and I see:
O, death's a most lamentable thing!

Nurse:
Methinks I see them, and will be more pitiful.

ROMEO:
O, death's a most lamentable day!

BENVOLIO:
If love be blind, love's transgression.

ROMEO:
Feather to the determination of a man,
Being both full of content, a joyful man;
being in so certain of his son,
and a joyful woman, I am in so childish
To think and but still no other,
Without more cherishing.

BENVOLIO:
What is the matter, gentle coz,
That is your composition?

ROMEO:
face to the bloody homicide,
Thou art perfect then, our lady.

BENVOLIO:
Give me thy hand, and with thy will.

ROMEO:
O, let us sworn the like to the story
How thou art pronounced.

BENVOLIO:
Let's to the Capitol;
And, with our sadness and your hainess,
To Marise me nightly in oldTitus Lartius' grave.

LARTIUS:
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.

BENVOLIO:
I will show you my true love.

ROMEO:
Shall sweet Bianca practise how they kiss one another?

BENVOLIO:
She came both to and to command, so neither toecity

How will this, dear father!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
God make you well! I see your ladys!

Be you well. Commend me to the prison,
Where I shall show myself a publicly benefit
To those you sent to make the givest;
If any of you will not show so much
As I am content.

ISABELLA:
I do beseech you,
By going to dispatch this deed,--no more of it;
If you will, why, Caius, and you;
The brother of your great enemy,
That Rome might be your officer.

MARCIUS:
O my good lord,
I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear a great pity,
I cannot with such pity.

ISABELLA:
The fault's mine, and I knew him.

MARCIUS:
The duty's mine, and duty's duty.

ISABELLA:
He's dead, deceased: off with the glanders and the sedges;
And with the other forfeits that do corrupt him.

ANGELO:
Sweet Marcius,--
Come, you hither. I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood between us.

MARCIUS:
Let's hence, and hear of your country's news?

ANGELO:
Lord, I could tell ye were come at a word
To wish me only he.

MARCIUS:
Most absolute sir,
Should he so come from the wars and hear
He vouchsafe to us.

ANGELO:
And he is taken to pieces with
To make the wars on him.

MARCIUS:
And with most prosperous arm
To this our common people!

ESCALUS:
I do beseech you,
Most absolute sir, my life is my foe's debt-breaker:
Be it poor that may be no more.

MARCIUS:
Let it be repeal'd, that the people may have
The lands and waters 'twixt your houses and my skill.

ESCALUS:
It does me sweat with these these these regs!
For what I thank, I cannot make true
Mine own children nor those I would!
Look, sir, I am bigger than my enemy's
A necessary evil, and void of my temper.

ISABELLA:
We will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Take it up straight:
Give it to them will O, the gods begin to fight.

ANTIGONUS:
He who does take it is dangerous.

MARCIUS:
Come, get you home; he shall to Brittany.

ESCALUS:
I'll see these movers whither have deserved
That which you look to fancy.

DUKEALL:
These make him to like.

ESCALUS:
Have done a brave deed! Ere't.

MARCIUS:
A cruel father! a terrible woman!
And to be heard, I warrant thee,
In the acting, whereof it was done.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If that thy offences were upon
Threw his offences, I would indeed have been heard
In the repeal'd.

ESCALUS:
I would I were here!

MARCIUS:
Let him be call'd for.

My lord,
Is't your former promise deposed?

Messenger:
Why, '! but he was none.

ANGELO:
Those are some stair-work: let me be put to death,
And I till death.

Provost:
Now to me, for this fiend of death.

ANGELO:
To his high end must I like it.

Provost:
And I must be so too, do I believe,
To be so tyrannous and in law,
When judges are first wounded.

ANGELO:
Tut, I do but tell those things hereafter.

Provost:
Must I tell you know this sir's noble fellow?

ANGELO:
He must both be happy and too strait in extremity.

Provost:
But, to the joy of the idle, it is so.

ANGELO:
He shall think it if we will.

 We'lljoin with you.

Now, the good gods, our Marcius, and
The consul!

COMINIUS:
Marcius!

MENENIUS:
He shall think
To undertake the rabble:
Besides, his body must be
The rock Tarpeian, and therefore
The Tarpeian.

MENENIUS:
What!

BRUTUS:
What!

MENENIUS:
What!

BRUTUS:
How!

MENENIUS:
How!

BRUTUS:
In such a business?

MENENIUS:
Because it were better for a noble servant to
Avoid his envy than where he abides,
And cannot live but by himself.

BRUTUS:
Despray you, let's home.

First Senator:
To our request he would not visit us.

HERMIONE:
What likelihood he'll show himself to our hearing?

MENENIUS:
Our doubts are trapp'd, and will be
Our prayers to priests andOur prayers to our soldier.

Schoolmasters:
What blame he will show us but that is not what we
Imagine an enemy.

COMINIUS:
We must all forth; he is a lion.

MENENIUS:
Nay, let us lose him by it.

First Senator:
Be it so; go home.

MENENIUS:
Nay, do not home.

COMINIUS:
Let's to our worship.

MENENIUS:
What is your will?

COMINIUS:
Are there not men
Desired to encounter your own so?

MENENIUS:


COMINIUS:
So.

MENENIUS:
But,
The will not be.

COMINIUS:
Despair not.

MENENIUS:
What honour, man? what honour!
The matter being a plague to yourselves,
Would not be thought upon you.

COMINIUS:
If the king had no son,
He would desire to ape him me.

MENENIUS:
The king!

COMINIUS:
With child, Marcius, he will course
The way of Rome, and of his strength unto
The end of war.

MENENIUS:
Even as he looks, you will hear
From your Marcius.

COMINIUS:
Yet, after all this fooling, I would not

MENENIUS:
And I, to shame you.

MENENIUS:
You'll marcius too, but Marcius not.

COMINIUS:
Why, therefore you shall not be the grave of your deserving;
For Rome's Coriolanus is our musty.

MENENIUS:
Why, there your stitchery.

COMINIUS:
But, come, you shall go.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not go.

COMINIUS:
Pray you, let's home.

MENENIUS:
Let's to them.

COMINIUS:
Away!

Away!

MENENIUS:
Now, the gates shall be shut:
Come, ye cot-quean, go.

COMINIUS:
These gates must be shut, and the people all
Must foot the and rid the way.

MENENIUS:
I'll leave my ceremony.

BRUTUS:
It is ceremony,
Not custom, nor custom.

MENENIUS:
All ceremony!

First Senator:
Anon!

MENENIUS:
Not ceremony,
If you had but looked big--

SICINIUS:
Pray your home.
Put us to the custom and instruct our duty,
Shall we desire to scakes?

BRUTUS:
We'll custom you custom you to your times,
As recompense us to come;
And to the people's custom and to come.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
What is your highness' pleasure I shall do with mine?

MONTAGUE:
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as my judge but I had not
To judge my other pleasure.
O, had it been a stranger thing to my intent!
Then again, methinks you seem'd to me;
Such was the wish of much urged man,
That, had I framed, would have been more pitiful.
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
I was too mean a man for thee; and so indeed,
That, to say this man were happy
We did, and to have some totwork of ceremony.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of the house of Lancaster
That made her sainted bow of virtue;
Such were I too, to look upon her.
O, thou caitiff! O, thou wicked!
Farewell, my lord! I'll to my tent
Where all my dressings are;
And to my tent my body were they are made
Under my colour.

QUEEN:
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
Shall we go down and bring the tassel
To power and greatness?
Shall we go play so nicely under our meaning's
To banish'd and banish'd?

KING RICHARD III:
Why, there thou hast need of more gage
Than feed my horse with methan.

QUEEN:
Feed not thy mistress, sweet Exeter,
Why I should wish thee but for the best,
And there thou set'st on, this way.

KING RICHARD III:
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?

EDWARD:
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I is sworn sworn brother to revenge,
I is sworn as a man.

WARWICK:
That's gladly: for the rebels which thou tread'st
Shall not be a stretch of course, lest sweet Exeter kneel
To tread the Alps, and live.

CLIFFORD:
 Alps, my lord.

MOPSA:
Where left we but one, or that are giddy, and full of his anger.

EXETER:
Where are those where, proud Plantagenet,
That we should be loath to break our meaning,
And sack ourselves the very sceptre of the modest moon.

KING RICHARD III:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of
Where our wretched father told me of!

Tullus A Menenius, I remember:
The very time Aumerle,
When I was Aumerle, he graced me down;
And wrathfully did scorn to me;
When I supposed, Marcius,
Aumerle found me not and what I was done:
But when he did take the kingdom from whence,
And set the women on my brother,
Unto the consent of all professors else,
They let me blame him.

See no more of him! I say, give him deserved
To fawn upon him till our army come;
And presently, when he had carried Rome and
Aumerle, we heard him say
'This mercy we have turn'd upon
This boy, I'll take it up straight.'

EXETER:
'Twas pity I did but smile till now:
And I could smile, good even,
To see my deeds of kin, but not a trouble
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
I am no breeching scholar in the degree
Of this proud man, that struck love his lovely sire
In the unpleasing heap, as some would tear us all.

MENENIUS:
Now, the drop, the father, and the shame:
Daffaffaffodils; what art thou doing here?

Pity's ensign yet I would wish me only he.

MENENIUS:
You might have been more pitiful.

Pity:
Prove it, thou varlet; you were so too.

MENENIUS:
Do you hear how he fell from the dirt
Of shame?

Pity:
What am I, think you?

And I am nothing slow to slack his weary words.

CAMILLO:
You do my master good: come, come.

FLORIZEL:
I come to know your pleasure.

POLIXENES:
You do me yours, and know mine own.

FLORIZEL:
So, no more of this.
Dear gentle maiden,--and the heavier, I know,
That ever I did see your brother:
A boy?

PERDITA:
A daughter, and a goodly one;
This were some stairworkworkworkworkwork:
The only son of Polixenes,
Who builds his hopes up of mercy,
Signed his design, by himself
To fail in your time; but this Marvell'd
His only son.

POLIXENES:
O he thinks
To unloose the province of this most grievous heap,
Lives not to act another such offence
As being smelt, and does not know
The unstooping malice and envy of the climate
That by his severity still
Exceeding on this proceeding.

FLORIZEL:
I think his sense
The thing he did to me last night,
That is not the envy in't:
If he had so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off.

MOPSA:
Pray, be with him,
And let him hear me speak before I say he sits.

FLORIZEL:
I dance attendance here; mark how he joth:
EachSlanders of his friends are he that countenance
To your presence.

MOPSA:
Came he my friend, speak.

FLORIZEL:
He jests at scars that never felt
Like labour with labour.

Now come I to speak, and ready to be executed.

FLORIZEL:
And wakes, I am come after to speak.

KING LEWIS XI:
Where be these enemies?

CAMILLO:
When some of them are gone, some are them
That follow'd upon us.

KING LEWIS XI:
Has said enough.

CAMILLO:
So it then.

POLIXENES:
The king is valued thirty thousand strong,
That thinks upon my count.

LEONTES:
Come, good my lord.

POLIXENES:
If 'twere by our means, thou butler
Fear'st our Marcius.

CAMILLO:
Your most obedient subject: were he not
The present deed would unpeople the province of your land
Measured to look upon you;
Be you beneath theta tuft
Of this most grievous guilty diligence.

POLIXENES:
I'll not believe
Nor need to live.

LEONTES:
If danger, by doing,
Beholder by the duty that you owe to't.

POLIXENES:
I'll do't, it is a penalty,
To pay my conjurations, and be put
To the hazard and to't.

FLORIZEL:
Where's that which shall I swear
In the dead bodies of the queen?

CAMILLO:
To safeguard thine own life
 from enemies that live.

LEONTES:
This night's cloak is done,
And more than done without fear or doubt,
By this most guilty murder done!

POLIXENES:
Meather'd it this afternoon,
Even as the cloistering lion in the leash,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with rage!
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.

LEONTES:
Once more, he knows where he should sing.

POLIXENES:
So it your pleasure is, the queen entreated again,
Which not anacock were I am acquainted with.

HERMIONE:
To pluck all of you out of love, it is decreed:
Even now undone! by Bolingbroke's means,
And by his count, how many friends of mine!

LEONTES:
Who is it?

CAMILLO:

LEONTES:
Go, your instrument.
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.

In the day before some cruel sleep doth come;

Or, if you return, go cross the seas,
To be whither and further we granted,
We may digest our complices in some form.

Second Servingman:
Whither would you like this going?

Third Servingman:
To serve all those men i' the world,
Whose ignorant credulity is not the motive
Of such a sharp-boding tongue.

Second Servingman:
What, master?

Third Servingman:
Why, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in your
bed, and betide him, and call him 'honour' when he said,
'Romeo, farewell!'
O Thou, pity! Come, poor gentleman!
What, at home, I'll back you till I am bigger;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
But to be remember'd, we'll play
The wantons with our woes,
To intercession too, which will out
In what men like this action.

Lord:
My lord, the mind of that ill deed
My mind hath clouded so much
That, if I be a wife, I'll
room within my power.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame a
burthen to boot it.

Lord:
Has said farewell already; and, in a most guilty diligence,
We three have cause to give the cause of noble Gloucester's death,
That I might might live a thousand years,
If I could lend ear report:
Yet, to the purpose.

GLOUCESTER:
To tell, good mother,--

PAULINA:
Not so:
For I will ride,
I warrant you, I will not be slack,
No, by your tricks I was tied,
No, by your tricks, but to stride
The way of death.

LEONTES:
Indeed, I have never any friends
From the dead, but only one:
The queen, blowing, he shall never come;
I pray you, take heed; for the place,
If e'er so.

PAULINA:
Not so:
For I dare so well put on,
Because, in the very siege of my power,
My sudden powers are weak and all ill left:
I would to God, this being in me,
So my untruth had not provoked him to it.

LEONTES:
Well, I must do't:
I am too young for not a while thou live.

PAULINA:
What, are you in me serious?

LEONTES:
No, in such bear as you are,
In this some unlook'd accident
That thou wot what I am.

LEONTES:
Be patient, good nurse!

EMILIA:
Beseech you, sir; be not afraid to scot.

PAULINA:
Not so:
Be patient, I say, and suffer't: by your patience, sir.
If something have befall'n upon you,
Your heads not mine: move.

LEONTES:
Go, be gone.

PAULINA:
I will not to bed to-night.

LEONTES:
To-morrow!

PAULINA:
Go, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These happy hours shall not determinate
Their part, but determinate
Your date of marriage, were short
To make the happy night.

LEONTES:
Go, be gone.
I would I were dead, or 'twere,
If this rebellious earth should be call'd
The glorious universal of their heaven.

PAULINA:
I pray now, call them!
Withdraw yourselves.
We must be brief when traitors brave the field:
Let's be brief when traitors brave the field.

LEONTES:
Takes but a trifle.

PAULINA:
It is too little:
Too little,
Within this limits of many mine teeth,--
For, though the nature of our quarrel
Help not, slight.

LEONTES:
Thy fault our father's fault, too!

PAULINA:
That is, sir, too good:
He that made us knows of
The corn he he does reap, was cruel,
In the desire he did minister.

LEONTES:
Thy fault our father's fault,
The mere conceit of his glory.

PAULINA:
So, be my child, that is not mine;
We will revenge.

Of this most grievous guilty murder done?

GLOUCESTER:
That I may live and see my shadow
 restored to health.

BUSHY:
Why, therefore Warwick's heart is purged.

WARWICK:
Blissentious Edward, that while thou livest,
Hadst purpose, a thousand waiting-on
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
And had not such an eye but sorrow's black veil'd
As that big heart doth still.

GLOUCESTER:
Widow, assign him to hell.

KING HENRY VI:
Then strike, courageous father, against my soul;
And let him live in peace, I'll go
To give him burial here in chains;
Away! duty!ply!

WARWICK:
Methinks I should leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
Where is York, and howWhere bloody Tybalt,
That King Edward, by his troops,
Were to send him brother Rutland hither:
If further powers cast him or soil mine,
That rivers cannot with these shores
Till that shores with beauty's roof.
And therefore, wheresoe'er we can, we'll drown
No more of this glory of York's enemies,
With like feeble thunder, as this world.
Therefore--

WARWICK:
Why, Warwick, thou our sovereign, and I behold
Our him and our foe, Warwick.

GLOUCESTER:
Here at the palace, sweet Warwick, hide me with tellt;
Affection is but crimson tempest, which the walls
against me have seen like.

WARWICK:
Then show me leave to the court, or tarry with me.

OXFORD:
I'll pierce the clouds with criers, my lords,
My heart, my blood, my sorrow, my sorrow's,
And never look upon me with my gracious eye.

WARWICK:
Tell not me of: but I will follow thee mine,
As thouver'st another good androusan.

CLIFFORD:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.

KING HENRY VI:
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Such is the wish of one Margaret,
Condemn'd upon the act of beauty,
That in the very grievous fault of it were as deep
As the death unmerriondeed'd. Thouches me not;
Thy place is fill'd with briers; thouThe third his son,
Who not contented but of the child,
But commanding a Lady Bona with her custom,
Under penalty, to see her friends were trapp'd,
Like to my fortune and thy love:
I do take the shame with being a pedlar;
But in the base court of York will I leave you;
And in the centre to Ravenspurgh will I come
To meet both thee and of my married day.

EDWARD:
Well, lords, I leave thee your prating:
To-morrow hold divided: no more pride
Can you make me do me with words and threats;
To-morrow hold divided: what thought,
 thou Thursday to-morrow,
To-day, gentle Warwick, by Wednesday,
That you should be England's king:
So few words but little joy,
Short minute of joy, but most weary:
What we three KING HENRY VI
And sands and triumph day,
Without striving less penity.

WARWICK:
Methinks I see Henry's death,
As being thisLast, by the latest leave
Of England's queen, by the which shall be
Her adopted heir.

KING HENRY VI:
Her friends call upon me;
And follow me, lords. I'll tell you what Margaret
Must we appear in these articles,
To tear withal the principal of my power.

OXFORD:
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For how canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When thou help'st me with so feeble a front
From under my arms I cannot brook the worst.

YORK:
Brother, you mistake the matter;
Nay, you do me this wrong:
 you all mistake. All too late,
When I supposed you heard you heard our traitor,
To associate with him, in the hope I had
That Phaethon should cheque my fiery steeds,
Which you to this purpose and yours,
And all the brothers of the fiends

We cannot disench our meaning,
Because, by thy helpments me, thou must
Upto bathe thy head in the Tower.

WARWICK:
Brothers, you shall go root away these flowers
From whence you came'st, and not the Tower.

KING HENRY VI:
If you love the king, why not I love him?
Now, therefore, I thank you.
If he love the king, why so it was my hate,
As I thought love him.

YORK:
 King Henry is deposed;
And now 'twas thought of.

KING HENRY VI:
O Margaret, now thy heavy curse
Shall strike the dust that King Lewis owes time to speak.

WARWICK:
And I'll leave my kingly throne, and call him brother.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The duty that I owe to your majesty
I seal upon the king is yours and I like him.

KING HENRY VI:
Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, let's home.
The common people are up, and you'ld leave these sad things
Where you should bear the king?

MONTAGUE:
If the king had no brother,
'Tis pity of him.

YORK:
We know not where; but you must trouble to get him
To some villanous shame:
With what we say, I'll hate the Tower,
As every loyal subject ought to do.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, therefore I'll home.

YORK:
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with his promise of stay.

KING HENRY VI:
Give me the letter.

WARWICK:
And I will look on it.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I will look on it and be gone.

YORK:
Be gone, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Away! let's home.

YORK:
Now, therefore let's home.

KING HENRY VI:
How now, gentle uncle! the queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with whom we have but two enemies,
To-day's peril and at our pleasure.

MONTAGUE:
If she have any hand over the king's word
for this, say how he fell out, that even now
I could not stay to hear him speak. O, he! the bloody parliament,
That he should perforce have
Keep Rome in safety, and that the people's
Shall have calls upon you, and says 'I,'
And that Lucentio indeed had show'd
The noble tribunes and patricians.

ROMEO:
I cannot tell:
So, but you must trouble him with his policy
To-morrow. If any plague hang over us,
Dispatch me presently a thousand-
but I have been still the Duke of orders grey,
And given a passage-gentle plot how to come by
Such. All too late, farewell:
Give me dead, I fear, and all my hopes
To succor you this afternoon:
What time to-morrow?

Once more, tell me, the lords you talk of found me dead!

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell: what presence must not there be?

Servant:
I cannot tell: O, it is almost clear dawn.

YORK:
Tentrs have strong and strong effects, and they are
Of wax and worth: for the king's name,
His captain knew no more but
Than what you do, he knows you
'Tis not to me for our honour, but our general:
I cannot tell what is grown in him.

BENVOLIO:
Because I now see the sight of comfort,
I am bound with heavy mind
To see so strangely. To behold!
Though the cause good and good wings make the past
Clean over-kind of their pride, yet need I leave it so:
Be ruled by me; let them be levied:
Let me know the charge my lord.

If he be not taken, with a crew;
I could by the time have mercy, or ' accustom'd.'

BRUTUS:
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
If it be sin to take by you, how are you men
Would valiantly bear with me in my arms?

MENENIUS:
If you take it not your highness' pleasure I had been
The first that citizens I have ever live,
O, but that I am a Duke of York,
Where he should live, not only my son.

SICINIUS:
I wish no better
Than to be by oath envious;
Or than I think, to be at envious:
I, as you will not
Have been down a day where ever I shall visit him.

BRUTUS:
By this, his entreaty,
As you would not make me any joyful day,
But, as you this covenant think,
We should to Bohemia and to see
This knack, devise by your mean how,
More than you, or we'll tell him where I am,
From the dead bodies of banish'd and forbidden legs;
Nor no one of you at your feet
But you must use your hands and be ruled.

SICINIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

BRUTUS:
For we to come too late of our intents,
We heard not how the king fell and did
Great Rome of such tame tricks:
He did, sure, that we had been
Softer and fix'd the good webs in Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
That's wish'd.

BRUTUS:
A wish, sir.

MENENIUS:
I had rather be a pedlar: if such thing be,
The soldiers shall beat you to your trenches
And make us suffer'd.

BRUTUS:
Such hope the queen and good ladies all
To come by the mean--

SICINIUS:
She shall not need, I hear;
We'll meet her nobly.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let's.

BRUTUS:
I hear, you must not.

Fie, you confute not how his patricians shall
Be ancus Marcius: were he more angry, I would

And here's Marcius;
Who made you hereaull'd and fell under his tent wall:
The hostess of the house.

I'll never trust to hear a word he does not know
What's given freely.

To thank the unpleasure of our general.

COMINIUS:

If you have heard your general talk of Marcius,
He were of present no more depth
Than such as mine:
He of glarence; is't your common fear?

If so, then mine good comfort is

And sound the trumpets, and about our task,
Why ready, and to battle with t'other,
Yet no more of this.

While I am thus bold with you in my lists,
To save the Duke of Clarence: and
While we reason here, what cause we'll

How dare you make us wretched?

O Margaret, I have Prithee in my tent
To hear him tell his disposition.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O yes, I can better play the orator,
To see inherited and by better use,
For how can I help!

KING HENRY VI:
But I have fallen too deep, as too deep as a grave
To make mine heart: O, patience, that never spake
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it is.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Whose soul is not the worst, to break the neck
Of that arch so hurried the queen!

Too deep?

O, my son, it is even now at my elbow,
To curse the offenders.

Which serves it and services of our strength.

For I have seen and heard him speak,
And doubt to use my babies' blows.

And yet you'ld like me.

CLIFFORD:
My pity let your tongue feel
That is your counsel.

QUEEN MARGARET:
More pity that the dark king
Should not be look'd to you!
Your enemies' marks of merit,
And the parents' noble names

by our faces?

CORIOLANUS:
You shall not own it. All your
good demands are to Marcius.

MENENIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours,--
You shall have none more shoes than feet;
For I will put you to 'scape their hands.

BRUTUS:
I am too mean a subject for your
buckle.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled by me.

BRUTUS:

Citizens:

BRutus!

MENENIUS:
BRutus!

SICINIUS:
What?

BRUTUS:
The people will not be satisfied:
we'll still the power we have, us confuter.

MENENIUS:
Pray, get you to your house: one thing more, one
that is a noble fellow.

First Senator:
The gods begin to strike!

BRUTUS:
What, art thou coz'd in this so?

MENENIUS:
Be, let's to them.

BRUTUS:

MENENIUS:
I know not where to turn: pray you,
when weeping was done, come sorrow was never
come into my house.

MENENIUS:
What! have you that lip
Should without the burthen know how to tell.

BRUTUS:
The burthen'd dread duke had so much contempt
for his contempt: contempt, selfless sorrow,
mutinies a usurer's dust and bone;
and desireeth now our tributary diligence.

MENENIUS:
What's the news i' the court?

COMINIUS:
None.

MENENIUS:
Your most cruel son!

First Senator:
Well, you companion.

COMINIUS:
Methinks he should be hated,
Which we will scorn to further trial.

MENENIUS:
If he were putting to my teeth,
He was content to conceal it:
The need and copy of you gave you would show
Your brows were mine.

BRUTUS:
Meaning, were you content to conceal it so,
Because you must colour it in the character
Of your own state; and you
Had not been considered.

MENENIUS:
If he could,
We'll draw you but one seven, or I'll most gladly draw
Twenty caged night, as this our assembly
Shall be my recreation: so, fellest,
Let us be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray.

First Senator:
How?

MENENIUS:
The tribunes are grown.

SICINIUS:
He's in the debt.

MENENIUS:
He'll track you better than you,
If you report him.

Second Senator:

Hail!

MENENIUS:
May their hearts!

SICINIUS:
These tribunes do people good, whom we were all,
To Marcius gone to Marcius,
Who attended to this place and
His country: where many of them,
With smiles, and smiles, as we had
To see this knack, as we thought,
That we were attended to this knack,
Yet one must think the other:
These Marcius must down,
Though he were Volicinius.

MENENIUS:
He cannot choose.

BRUTUS:
Cannot young.

SICINIUS:
Because what we call him an old
Must vouch the

And he, from his mother, from his child,
To strew his grave with senseless cries:
'Yea,' quoth he; 'dost thou hear me;
I cannot help it now, to I dare.

VOLUMNIA:
Be ruled by me; let me know my fault:
If you dare please to think I love the child,
As 'twere pity of him.

MENENIUS:
No, by such despair, as you think on mine.

VIRGILIA:
If she agree, Marcius would not be content:
For what she could say was in me,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

MENENIUS:
Now I know your mind.

VOLUMNIA:
You'll mar her to some place.

MENENIUS:
This Marcius would not seem to me, I know it.

SICINIUS:
Pray you, go hire this surgeon.

MENENIUS:
The bawdyed canopy soundly.

VOLUMNIA:
Mum.

MENENIUS:
Go, lay'st by your waiting-harming.

MENENIUS:
I go, he isJust: is there no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

SICINIUS:
So it must fall out with him.

MENENIUS:
So it must fall out
To pay for those things you have done.

SICINIUS:
He's with the Emperor!

BRUTUS:
May not your lordship live?

VOLUMNIA:
Now he's in command.

MENENIUS:
Farewell, he's dead:
The office he does require,
To plant superstition, to purge
From whence we wish'd him only mercy.

BRUTUS:
Be he unto us!

MENENIUS:
Show them my unbarbed sconce,
And not our flesh till after
You kiss the moon.

BRUTUS:
Certain tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
Here's some good matter.

MENENIUS:
This afternoon, Marcius, 'tis by:
I'll to them;
But Marcius should not show himself.

BRUTUS:
Let's to them.

First Senator:
Come, come.

MENENIUS:
Here's a noble fellow.

COMINIUS:
Let's to them.

BRUTUS:
Come, get you home;
To keep your power.

MENENIUS:
What is't o'clock?

SICINIUS:
Upon the stroke of ten.

MENENIUS:
Well, let them come.

BRUTUS:
I will some way.


First Senator:
To the Capitol;
To-morrow: hang hie with the cricatep,
With kingly up- coats brushed and your custom.

SICINIUS:
Hark, Marcius!

BRUTUS:
Marcius!

MENENIUS:
Why, that's your bawcock. What, art thou sure
All's true?

BRUTUS:
If whispering must not work, 'tis by
Your good report is of Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Be certain Marciusuke, where is your power?

BRUTUS:
When he is absent, he thinks you.

MENENIUS:

COMINIUS:
I'll hear more.

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus!

BRUTUS:
Let's hear.

MENENIUS:
You'll hear them speak.

COMINIUS:
Be absolute for me.

MENENIUS:
Do not they fear bawd?

BRUTUS:
If they fall in earth as the flesh is.

SICINIUS:
Here's to my tent;
There where you'll show your cambrics and
My most disloyal friends.

BRUTUS:
Cannot your worship change these garments
My tongue can brook yet undeft!

MENENIUS:
He does us scorn to come; our general
Will not live to what contempt he does.

SICINIUS:

Accountant to this mockery. All will he speak;

To the young prince, my brother.

And Rona henceforth art thou slain,

CLARENCE:
O bitter oath, I like it not.

LEONTES:
That which I am sworn to:
God revenge it, and I'll obey it.

ANTIGONUS:
Be patient, lady: prove you tyrant!

PAULINA:
Not so, prithee, live, speak you:
Two of you are yet made I promise of your coming forth.

LEONTES:
Nine changes of the left side.

PERDITA:
Nine! Come, you are well understood to be a queen.

LEONTES:
Nine! Come, let's hear these articles.

First Citizen:
Will't please your citizens to reason this
How they are by, but by--

PAULINA:

Must I say?

Pray you, call them?

Citizens:
To your, and then?

PAULINA:
Do;
I am yourShown say you shall.

LEONTES:
I will,
Your own, your own.

PAULINA:
Well, I must do't:
Your honour's players, if you bring them down,
That we may soon persuade yourShown hate, although the
Most of us you do not like.

LEONTES:
Why, that's nothing.

PAULINA:
More than with such lies he with child,
And from his infant's womb children of
Being pent from liberty, as he is
Even now to liberty, as I thought
In.

LEONTES:
You do not know
What I can urge against the people.

ANTIGONUS:
I know
I cannot tell; but I was sworn
To him their children were bad.

LEONTES:
You must trouble them no more.

ANTIGONUS:
So.

LEONTES:
Be ruled by him.

ANTIGONUS:
Though he be youngest, give him leave to go,
Or walk in an equal force to a molehill should his son come,
Who can lick a Juno-tree:
Marry, let him go:
Though the nature of our son be gentle,
He's a man to nature,
Not quite so hit in years, but quite out
With what he stands for.

LEONTES:

Mark, my lords, he bears himself,
As you were lead in the chair by him,
When he did sit about the corn, he let him say
He bore my father;
And you shall bear him my lord, too and do
Your pleasure.

LEONTES:
Did Julius Caesar had been more respected
Than what you are, by this discovery,
By this discovery lost. Behold, my lord,
The man you talk of came into my mind
What body must this famous, and my title lost;
And, if I thou be a subject to your honour,
Tell me why I was, and what I am?

LEONTES:
That I'll claim by your honour's terms,
But never to remember it other day.

PAULINA:
Why, then the good gods forbid!

LEONTES:
I go:
Get thee to question, follow.

ANTIGONUS:
To-morrow, then, we'll part;
To-morrow, or next day:
He's with child, my lord.

LEONTES:
In my father's mood;
Without an argosy,
That does nothing but conceit,
Nothing but conceit.

PAULINA:
So it should seem
To unloose the province with the child.

LEONTES:
By the child,
Out of their cares, past care,
Give way unto your cares, and thereby
Your tediousness shall be used
In theirs, so it should be thought
To spur them all.

LEONTES:

But this most needful usage,

From east, west, north-boding night.
Go, take your bozeny to the shore;
Methinks you look as if you were a boar to
Boar to the Montagues:
O, I am heavy too heavy to tigers
That creeping toward the dirt and toil.

KATHARINA:
That's cruel father; 'tis well:
He bears it in the almostness of blood.

KATHARINA:
Had I more respect than my life,
Or my life and these these these these these terms,
Would make me rich, or these riches were
I would wish them.

KATHARINA:
I cannot tell:
Why, thus have I done, and thus have I done:
If I were a horseman by this,
'Tis to be by oath enjoin'd,
And therefore by stealth I should be
This afternoon his son-in-law;
If he be sleeping, why let him fear
What separated mess'd he must be whilst he were
Under his command, and that all were
From under and by
To perform the rite of solemn duty:
Under my penalty, I'll do myself
A duty that may
But please the heart, and in my temper
To faithful service of your majesty. And, if you love the king
That hath not a tomb so evident as this chair
To extol what it is, I'll give him leave
To go, anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Be- planted many years, planted many years,
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
And live with trembling voice, yet never hear more
From such aribbon as this flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms! I curse the gods! those eyes of thine sweet babes
Hath frown'd on my husband, and with our spleen
Cuck but shadows of his pride!
 those years of happy days, I'll sing and dance!
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
We'll tell tales tales and tell tales, but we'll tell tales,
Such as you love.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Bear, I say; Northumberland, and the hare:
Ay, so shall my care stay.

KING LEWIS XI:
But why stay we now? let us tell tales't:
How you have drunk together, how he drunk,
Being the nearest thing is my care, for our bones
Came undone by the water and cold,
That makes himself, but indirectly,
'Yea,' quoth he, that we might be seen and not
Like us. Lords, I will tell you this:
The cause is, the greater cause of my blood:
If e'er you be, I'll be your follower;
But ere you be a follower, so mighty.

KING LEWIS XI:
What cause, art thou, Northumberland?
What cause, should music and stone,
Think you 'scape? art thou against consent
And trust my love? What duty, andof what sorrow craves
The respite of thy mistress' name?

GLOUCESTER:

Lady:
If I were thy mother's champion,
Then I had left my kingly throne,
Where it did please me; and there I stood,
At upper end o' the table, and lolling-stand;
I no more of it. All my say'st thou, Northumberland;
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
'Tis like to be avoided,
That is, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the best
In my life, for both of you are birds

Lord:
Think you so?

First Servant:
Tears hear I speak; tears shall.

Or be they live that age.

Let their revengeful drops of life.

Owe did kill the souls of the queen;
And she's dead toish possession.

QUEEN:

Shall be your remembrances: so,

To rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.

So too.

KING RICHARD II:

YORK:
So perhaps; I will not here and yet.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, so.

YORK:
Why, so: I pray thee, go;
I pray thee, take these and these rights.

KING RICHARD II:
A hundred thousand years.

YORK:
Why, that's a thousand years.

KING RICHARD II:
Sweet king, I thank thee not; for thou art
In me, and many a minute ere this dog
Shall come to a foul swain.

QUEEN, thou sleepest with me; for thou canst make me tremble
To think I can match thee not.

KING RICHARD II:
O no, thou canst not now; I can come to't.

QUEEN:
Anon! what, king?

KING RICHARD II:
Thou, thatstarest will to God in heaven,
 tie thee to his holy sword,
Be he that was wont to rise by man and
 by action little detected,
From such false and wrong, as this weather
To stain the temper of a gracious palace!

QUEEN:
But heaven's black sceptre, with his consent,
Is ne'er the king's proud-minded earth,
That can so himself have glory glory and joy!
For what is he, I can tell you.

KING RICHARD II:
But he is of such descent,
That cannot judge so cruel effects of pity.

QUEEN:
So must my soul, being pent from liberty,
Be sent for hither, to by my jealousies,
To by my jealousies, by his jealousies:
I come from Mantua, and by my brother's guard
Against the envy of those that scorn
Which the king by this most cruel usage,
Against the glittering king of kings.

KING RICHARD II:
So must your majesty
Give me assurance of my love!

QUEEN:
By and by; behold, when I am king,
My heart is not whipt out of me to what sorrow
It is.

KING RICHARD II:
Madam, and I fear,--

QUEEN:
By means.

KING RICHARD II:
Because your majesty hath straitly given you sleepy means
To make you mad, and that with it will
Have every child, by the mother's means,
To have an heir
Till I had him and be rid of you.

QUEEN:
'Tis but a cavile:
You must be content to go with me.

KING RICHARD II:
To happymorrow I wish'd happy days,
To happy days, short joys.

QUEEN:
Who meets us here? they're gone together?

DUKE OF YORK:
Where it seems best unto the king?
He is with the king your father.

KING RICHARD II:
Would all were well! gracious majesty!

QUEEN:
To-morrow, then: who meets us here?
We'll stay, the king thy brother: farewell:
What presence must we have to entertain
To make our guests friends?

Messenger:
My lord?

KING RICHARD II:
They shall meet us on their way:
There shall we lie, and they are almost show'd
in our country.

Messenger:
So they shall meet us.

KING RICHARD II:
Shall we meet, and go with us,
As we wish our lives before death?

Messenger:

You'll mar him to his grave immediately!
O unbid spite! Marcius too,
That is your bawd; Marcius too,
Or what is opposite to every bawd?
You must report to the Capitol;
To-morrow:
Look, how the people's, that we do show
My Titus Lartius, by your Caius Marcius, by
Your very worthy Marcius.

MENENIUS:
O, good,
You must be not so bold in the Capitol;
For examine after three parts
You know the army is down.

BRUTUS:
O, were it not yours?

SICINIUS:
No, good, good.

MENENIUS:
Why, 'tis Marcius poor, and by Marcius poor:
a merriment is not the worst
Yet one that could fancy more.

BRUTUS:
By three parts of Marcius,
If Marcius were my name, I would desire
To reconcile him to your friendly peace:
For Marcius would not satisfy,
But you will get power after many wars.

MENENIUS:
What's the matter, sir?

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your liege;
For Marcius is grown
Too proud to Marcius.

MENENIUS:
He's in the character of his son Marcius.

BRUTUS:
May your highness live, and wish him well.

MENENIUS:
Now the good gods forbid!

COMINIUS:
Farewell, my friends.

MENENIUS:
Farewell: farewell.

COMINIUS:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius, it is not the way
To call him unelected.

MENENIUS:
He's old, I young: give him leave,
We may have open means to come to him.

COMINIUS:
He must think by rote and could put
No way to fit him.

MENENIUS:
The rock when he did retire his back'd frets,
Remember 'tis the wind that he struck home,
Remember 'tis the rock that he whence he derived.

BRUTUS:
Pray he be to them and home. I am
The boy of warriors, when he is of directitude
To certain death: therefore shall he be heard
In the base o' the city.

SICINIUS:
Here come the lords.

BRUTUS:
Your Coriolanus
Must strike home, and so prove you true
In the disposing of the disguised.

MENENIUS:
Do not draw the chair into his shroud;
Pray you, you, remove the power that you have,
For being i' the base court, come before us;
Let us be content to endure
To one whom you must think you were revell'd,
And he shall think
To you that dare be so bared in this business.

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius!

MENENIUS:
Ay, worthy Menenius; and I request you
To yield Cominius, Coriolanus,
If you be aNoble Menenius.

BRUTUS:
Must I do so? must he show himself,
As I do in Rome.

TITUS:
You must do it,
Tullus Aufidius; and you must
Be ruled: we'll to Rome,
Where your powers are,
Not bound to directitude, but to be
Our occupationant, by your power.

I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A noble construction. I must to Rome
To welcome the mother to my tribunes

gentle work of power.

Was to me; it was to me; this is not

If you had the ordering of the mind
Then come to me; but, in the bawd,
I would not fit your consent to yield.

And yet my neck are stiff; and yet,

ANTIGONUS:

If he did manage my friends,
Those veins that spring from him.

LEONTES:

PAULINA:
Seal up the thought of him;
You make a mutiny among your enemies,
And sound a treaty where you were to cut it.

LEONTES:
I would he had been my lord!

PAULINA:
No, I dare't:
Let him's play'd my part, and left me no more
To cross my friendship till now:
No, take more:
What, my lord.

Thou'rt an end of match,
Which never truth hatht deserved.

Away, prepare
To cross my seas, so it be,
First, to miss the fairies' kiss.

LEONTES:

She melted, but contrary to my heart:
What dagger that I had!

EMILIA:
Do you mistake, man?

PAULINA:
Neither.

EMILIA:
If I had a heart as dear as his,
Those thoughts of mine shall make you hate:
As those beside, do me right;
With them fair as they are.

PAULINA:
Should I bear be, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which is your shame,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you,
My lord?

EMILIA:
Marry, I will; and will,

You would not be seen.ches with your knees
Of mine; and so, to say farewell,
Were you sworn to us, and that my Katharina
Bade be immoderate, so tutor'd
By your countenance!

Thou'rt an oath between two and me;
And that you quietly were all
From when you were first wounded.

No, good queen,
No, is not thisforce withheld:
Asal,

Your stoop-fant brother: a man of mine,

If she more fit to furnish me your daughter
Against infection and the hand of death.

And after I said that she came to't bravely

I am most fortunate, thus have I deserved

Of hostileawns, his alliance got
To marry her hence.

GLOUCESTER:
At my feet I bear a due andage;
And when I am cold in zeal to this delay,
Then I'ld have no excuse
To call me brother? when was he, sure,
When I did see him, and I know how he lived,
He let me bear him; forget, and not an oath
To call him brother.

YORK:
I would I were dead to-day,
When I supposed you he had come
And had no cause to seek him.
I would these two hours
Had left no mourning widows for my death;
And, as my felling, he suppined
To take away all duteous shame,
And quite didst take order.

Where I thought, I look'd when some of you should say
I did mistake.

Then have my soul stumbled; I look'd when some of you should say
That ne'er I did see my cousin.

These words revive my heart!

That no more revenge'd by my body.

Then have I done a brave deed. Ere done I promised,
And yet I would it were to give again.
To tell you what, I have been promised:
The next heir of my father and the next heir
Of these two thine close earth.

YORK:
Brother, you are not with me; I have not been promised:
But, if you be a gracious gentleman,
That were being tender, I'll give my jewels
A most inherent baseness.

GLOUCESTER:
Believe me, I have been deceived:
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
My lord and you will not endure your stinking stars,
Till either my death or life.

Therefore, have mercy: I would I had you play with jest.

GLOUCESTER:
But I am still a patient.

YORK:
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of day; and have been royally appointed
With one that I might be denied, recall it.

For I have bought a gentleman with child,
Upon which yours honour is as boundless as mine.

YORK:
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
In smooth discourse, as I
Shall in our request, since your brother
Doth make us rich, all are punish'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Then let us hence; and, with speed,
Go I to the block-head of the main.

Direct me to the block, and let me know my fault:
No, good brother, take me;
I'll vouch the other instruments.

KING HENRY VI:
Peace you, widow: I had rather be a mourner,
Than a good to be of my kind.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, thou art perfect then, our queen and I.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, you have made a happy spring by this land:
Where sits this large kingdom of kings, you

What faults he made I shallow? I thought it good;
And where to, to be or what my fault,
To utter ruin of a Marvellous heap,
Anon, for blest worthy Marvellous estimation,
That hath touch'd the very nerves of state,
And gnaw'd the awful slaughters of kings.

PAULINA:
Sweet father, let's hear.
The day serves well for them now.

LEONTES:
What, with less lagging sword,
Than with a club, and under penalty,
To make me tremble? I do not know
How he fell out, as being cast, and descried
From the dead bodies: I'll take him up straight
Yea, or no more.

PAULINA:
O, let my brother live!
He must not live, I tell you; and I'll bribe him
To buy and sell their lives. Commend me to my cousin
Cut me to pieces.' What seal is England's law to bend?
Throwns transgression to the ground;
And patient under penalty,
If power change purpose,
Had borne the matter by deed,
And that the queen's kindred were strong.

LEONTES:
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, captain:
Under your canopy you shall not hide his music,
But you shall come to hear his tale pronounced.

HERMIONE:
Mortal, thou cutt'st not this song,
For 'tis a usurer's name;
And I had rather had the request of the ear
 Music. You, the Duke of York,
And I, my good heart, set down this hour:
Short tale to come, my lady's grave:
venture is foolish, and we may not
Our prayers do. Down, to stand all apart;
Right hand, our duty is too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to us,
I cannot but to single my;
Since one seven years I have been there.

LEONTES:
Alas!

First Lord:
Why, so, my lord,
When I, thy vouch against the metaphysics,
First Lord, behold, and hear, that I may vouch,
My noble cousin's ghost: fie, take it off,
And live with me for once.

MOPSA:
Or, if I live, 'tis he.

LEONTES:
Cousin, I'll knock once more.

ANTIGONUS:

LEONTES:

Then I desire but to reconcile me
To his most gracious promise:
Such oath as long as you, my lord,
Have done, and long live.

LEONTES:
I am glad, I shall see
This vouch against the Greeks.

MOPSA:
Or, if I live, 'tis by:
But I can't fit you to call your majesty
With one that you'll be your liege.

LEONTES:

What you can underta'en to back
Against the Greeks. The matter,

To retire yourself to-day.

PAULINA:
I know
Thy noble father is tired, and I am weary:
He's up-roused many years,
Whisper his son, and some his sons;
And, till I am up-roused,
He will not sit me down, you wrangling:
If I be not, heaven pity him!
But heaven, pity man, and I.

LEONTES:
No, by my troth, I can tell him where I lie,
And where you will most adventure
To this most patient,
That is not your highness?

PAULINA:
For any thing, my lord,
That can befall you to this but the loss
Of such a lord as yourself?

LEONTES:
He cannot go on me, I tell you; commanded,
His duty and his duty;
And therefore I yield unto him:
He cannot choose; and therefore, I pray you,
He, by your leave, by your steed's right,
By the fair'st creature in the year,
Fancies too weak for one thing's worth:
'Tis but his policy
To haste thus fast, because he is
Where nothing but himself,
Without so mighty spirit, to fashion
Unto the appetite and feeding lion.

LEONTES:
But I know
He's not proud, but bound so well,
That, were his featiful,
He were not content to gird the gods
Of such trifles, to tear
And bow his nature, to humble me to humble
And mercy at his feet I cannot forget
The favours of his proud adversaries:
But, were my lord, it should be
That I had been thus beholding at him
In the high year of this famous Plantagenet,
Mean time had been, my lord.

LEONTES:
Ay, my good lord:
But I'll report nothing else
But one: more of the good gods will plague
That we report:
And in this I pray thee, speak.

ANTIGONUS:
'Tis full of thymycels; and one of those gods
That makes the gods look down, behold, and you
Shalt despair. Who is't can make us good?

PAULINA:
The pedlar of such a need,
The croeigned vesture of my glory,
The glory of my sorrow's glory,
Even in the lusty havior of his son,
He capers nimbly in the base of my sorrow,
And sedition enough:
For what miscarries
Shall I live on to say.

LEONTES:
Why, that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
And quite overthrown. Who is't can blame him?

PAULINA:
We'll all together weeping and make a dearth in your
greatness, when evil deeds of charity.

Herself amorous as her proud-minded wife,
And with her left to goail and weep,
That she might come to him and be in marriage
Of blessed garland.

And in the mind of men it so alter'd.

Than so great as was the former when you did,
Or that is not so?

BRAKENBURY:

CLARENCE:

BRAKENBURY:
Despair not, sir.

CLARENCE:
Who brought you the benefit of these two?

CLARENCE:

Whose bloody mind, as it is, did kill your love;
And I'll pawn the little blood which he does own,
For you own are he tyrannous to you.

Would buy and practise over at will.

To make a stale of me amongst those I minded.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, 'tis my bawd; for King Bolingbroke
Where is the Duke of Clarence, that cruel prick?

QUEEN MARGARET:

But in this uncase circumstance,
'Tis best using me to be the women
And bring you some other than your dancing soul
To some foul purpose.

KING HENRY VI:
Wilt thou have any more dancing under his command,
And he not like to me?

QUEEN MARGARET:

To pluck all and leave unloads thee.

But what kindness, jealous, and in my rage
Have made me give the lie,
In this unmade brideged humour of my will
And made the forest tremble as the wind.

Keeper:
My lord, will't please your highness to come?
If not, I shall be slack; I will not be slack,
But only my quicken. What fit is your highness' pleasure
To any unpleasing child,
Unto the brother of your famous brother?

DUKE OF YORK:
Why, 'tis my son's name that gallopsed my heart:
Young Ned, and thou vouchsafe,
For that I was his adopted heir;
This is out of k being old and left,
Even for the inheritance of thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What have we done, Clarence? or how?

CLARENCE:
Erroneous trick! and so in too!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yet I we were born to be awaked.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, brother? wilt thou be so?

CLARENCE:
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
He tires betimes that never felt
Thean time were longest there:
Light vanity, insatiate cary!

But all are told false: and all are told,
That the after-meeting have I made my death:
What! Wherefore, where was it, that revell'd earth?

AEdile:
Some wherefore, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
To thee, my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And to me, were it not pity, holy father,
To me as my soul is, behold, as heaven sees heaven,
I bear a child.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the child is yet a stranger in my womb,
And will not be cross in talk: O, break, my lord,
And I will be king, or die.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Brother, you muse what you have said
Your children not homeward: I'll be king,
And we will be sworn: duty, and you will be
Untainted by your enemies.

GLOUCESTER:
Be Duke of Clarence, and let me be Duke of Clarence.

CLARENCE:
To me, then my comfort is that
You make a dauphin, and in his holy mind;
And, when we have drawn you from the field
Shall frown and make the princes look ready to come;
When theirs, as they whereof, we need not
To make a dauphin like you.

GLOUCESTER:
So I would your majesty
Look on England, at this just siege
What mutiny were it to me. First, how canst thou urge
To prick the finger of the desirers with these your enemies?

CLARENCE:
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet Clarence:
Why, brother, 'tis my right:
When you and I were at Exeter, when
The two kings were chosen soldiersame you their lords.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why now, brother Clarence! in what?

CLARENCE:
The brother of Clarence, by the like notice,
Give'd the notice ofEvery danger,
And to the marriage of Henry my brother.
If this law hold in us ten times
That Henry shall be fearful of your death,
Then, as we think, we make our law:
Because you, Catesby, you, that are free of this charge,
Shall be so much forth friendly.

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, I do not like this flight of justice;
But to

Wherein you canjourn.

ROMEO:
I'll swear,'tis Mariana,
If once she there pent up some score or two of you'll best know.

CAPULET:
Come, you confute not so ill: come, go,
In arms as fast as told: I will but remember you.

JULIET:
Give me word: I'll try.

Nurse:
Marry, God forbid!
I knew my father but once.

JULIET:
'Tis not mine.

Nurse:
How? gone, man! Where is my lord?

JULIET:
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

Nurse:
Are you a maid?

JULIET:
A widow by my father's years,
Where I am now, pack'd and lock'd, when you were then?

Nurse:
Here in your bosom; I now remain'd.

JULIET:
A pretty one are you here? A boy? a goauteous one;
Huffless for you when you were younger then.

Nurse:
Get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that never felt I.

JULIET:
I'll leave your iron dagger, here it stands: I'll cross the dirt
Of my dug-work, for I will not cross the dirt.

Nurse:
Have you many rounds of their pride?

JULIET:
Nine, sweet, a most excellent piece of work, my lords.
Come, go with me; for this exercise,
Where you shall have some scope, if you were a butcher.

ROMEO:
I judge not but they will fly to and will fly to their liking.

JULIET:
Othe gods! good nurse,--Hast thou mock'd'st!
She is your midwife's name; I know thou art
The mother of Hercules, and my daughter,
The moon of some strange nature, that landers
To make your smiles thick and deformed and un appear!
Thy mother was most true-born body,
O, yet thy face!thou seest!
Bes! I see thee, I wot!

ROMEO:
Lo, with a face! thou mother's beauty makes me most forward
Than is my pity to poor children' heads:
Nay, take up the masks of mine and hide the face;
I will lay one crutch'd with thee;
Doubt not where to stand for an't:
For when I did see thee and pray'd,
My brows are full of discontent,
And yet the discontent of the mind;
Thy mother felt more pain than any pain.

ROMEO:
O, take me with thee; let me have pity'd thee.

JULIET:
O, thou happy nurse, be not angry with thee;
What thou hast said is fit thy soul.

ROMEO:
So happy was I for the death!

JULIET:
A blessed labour, in such a business.

Nurse:
Well, I do with thee; for thou shalt know
The value of any thing we ordained festival,
And we will be bound and enfold'd.

ROMEO:
Such father as thought,
Would force together; and that with speed
To greet both festival and holy thoughts,
At Hallowmas: I'll bear thee word and time
To come; for this is a wedding-day.

CAPULET:
But fought it out and not our tune,
Which the rather
We came to our tune: come on, my tullus;
Bes, king! not so tune o' hearts,
But stoop as dear labour to the tune o' the mind;
The orisons of two kings' reigns:
And I, good lord, take that word,
To leave unthrifts, rather than come on:
Give me excuse, good father. I love thee better,
Than such bad dealings must be seen in thought of.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Well, he is gone unto the sanctuary,
And is with him, Archbishop Lodowick. Now, for this night:
I will take it;
And this will hardly be, slight, nor in favour:
I willigold, friar, till I am bigger;
D location wise, treacherous, pernicious moveable,
In all unstable as the wind
Thatribhath wash'd: yet your power
======================================== SAMPLE 33 ========================================
 place them both.
Now this extremity of soul's malice is reason
Most dangerously to me; and it is not
To the child, the innocent child, whom I detest before thee,
If she, by cruel cruel Clifford's rigour,
Had some offences in him or in his derived,
He should have show'd all that which you
Shall deny him lawful king.

GLOUCESTER:
Off with her, I like not thy children' faces
But 'tis your name, not some other
But:, as we may, we will; and
If you will be England's king,
Then why should not this be England's king,
Take back this captive scold crookback rather than marry her dames?

KING RICHARD II:
Sweet widow,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own folly--the society,
Amity too, of society,
Amity too, of person, to be all,
And thus I am beguiled, either
Or to be thus bold in my too cruel a fashion,
Could to crush a complete father's body up
Shall make the lie: and therefore I came,
From your good graces' minds, when traitors brave Plantagenet,
That held an end to-day,
To know the cause of my loving York
Was done to death:
God will revenge it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Stay, live, and see what your boys'L seize upon you.
If you can bring your lordship's thoughts,
Confirm the napkin and your white son
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of this most grievous guilty murder done?

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet widow,--goddess!--O, belike it is,
Darest with thy bridal-heart thus, to displace it!
God will revenge it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I will show thee my true love's kiss,
And so unlander'd be thy hand.

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, sweet widow, so thrive I see
PRINCE EDWARD:
To happy years shall never be Richard's friend.

QUEEN MARGARET:
To curse that poisonous bunch-back'd Henry!

GLOUCESTER:
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks,
And to his most sacred person,--a man
More proud than the infant that is born.

CLARENCE:
To curse that poisonous bunch-back'd Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Thanks, gentle Clarence; worthy brother; and thanks unto you all:
I pray thee, let me know; for I will ride,
As fast as means to come by un mighty power.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And I will too, willing to your grace's will,
Which is the knedgeable and to be obedient.

GLOUCESTER:

KING RICHARD II:
Troth, that idle weeds are fast in growth
Where growth stands but to climb a branch now
By need and accident.

CLARENCE:
So it should seem
That I should be England's king.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
We will, our Clarence: but to bite the lip
Of that lie whereof I didall I wounded you.

KING RICHARD II:
What, hadst thou groaning, if thou hadst fear'd.

CLARENCE:
Be patient; never will I rise up-pray.

KING RICHARD II:
That mercy whether Edward's sword bewitch'd,
Or pity or instructing.

QUEEN MARGARET:
That's all one, or that news can?

KING RICHARD II:
If without peril it be possible,
So please you, majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To-morrow night look to see
 dagger, there is a witless limit
Which they upon me looks upon.

KING RICHARD II:
O, know you yet, they lie in me.

GLOUCESTER:
Hie you to hell for this unwonted deed!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Tut, already, my soul! 'tis not my hand,
Nor my heart, nor these some words.
'Yea,'tis husbanded by my father's fault,
Their marriage-givery on

 HORTENSIO:
A holy witness may this prove,
Before a vulgar duke take her hence.

MARIANA:
Most gracious regent,
Is this your speeding know our mind
From such a filthy fellow as himself!
Now, belike and charity of such a person,
Among fresh female buds shall I trample
To your pleasing: on my white heart
is he that made us all, and most accursed
By the severity of the public power.

COMINIUS:
That fellow is a fellow of the house of Montague.

MARIANA:
More pity that the eagle was being a gentleman!

ANTIGONUS:
Brags of his authority overpeer'd;
The one that is your enemy: Cleomenes and Dion,
The god of my idolatry, are both gods
In one and the neither gods.

LEONTES:
That fellow's a poor fellow;
His surely I had him.

FLORIZEL:
Hail, royal Mariana!

Lord:
A very Happy man!

FLORIZEL:
Hail to you, my lord! I have thought long
To see the happy gentleman so ill as I have:
Such goodly speech and such a lover's words,
Asfortune, light, gives me happy tidings;
But most of him they say is a rascal;
And why, Mariana,
Where'er thou wast but three-score of need, you have
Thatwer'd the lives of thee,
Shorten'd the stroke and pain of death,
And heap'd the needless helps of unburr'd.

HORTENSIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion,
Yet makes him seem merry: come, come, good and let's home.

FLORIZEL:
I cannot tell:
He must show himself so amiss an'tay,
When he did see his country.

LEONTES:
O, that must be
Ere he express himself!

FLORIZEL:
I cannot,
Because you must show his disposition better
Than so would be another such an officer.

LEONTES:
His disposition better bound to 'tis,
His oath of perpetual peace, and continued from his oaths:
Because, as he hath been an officer for many affairs,
I have been false to him.

FLORIZEL:
That I have,
But for an idle close curtain in this lent,
To finding him our soldiers, to show his disposition,
And disposition of unwarr'd after oath,
To avoid the carping censures of the world.

LEONTES:
Attend me, Angelo.

Officer:
Cousinio, blood, thou art worthy; and thy oaths
Shall be the highest.

LEONTES:
Me, give me this dagger,
Or, if not so, make my wars with you.
If I may or know this which is your former promise,
Might or our estimate, to-morrow!

COMINIUS:
That's to us or ours.

LEONTES:
 nay, but give us this dagger.

POLIXENES:
This is the last:
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.
So, now the gates are ope: you'll leave us.
If you'll fight with us, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.

LEONTES:
You'll not be undone:
Good-hearted warriors,
Your former presaging, to the base slaves' graves
Shall perforce have judicious treads.

HERMIONE:
If his highness come,

Encourage him.

POLIXENES:
O, belike he thinks
To unloose him: sure, he met fell down,
And to the ground he did fashion me.

FLORIZEL:
In very good bringing up,
And not the giving of one another
Would make him say and read by himself.

LEONTES:
Came he met there?

FLORIZEL:
At the very one gave him bonfires;
Condilated almost with the black incontinent,
Ereused for practise.

LEONTES:
You'll mar all the world if you were a
Conitent. Camillo's wounds are bleeding shed
Even from the blood of those he sent me: I cannot
consorted him directly, nor from the very
end of the people

Sweet gentle Marcius, let's hence and die
To see this news.

The king isvis'd:
For Marcius!

MARCIUS:
He is in the mighty hold
Of second and third, by the consent of all,
To Marcius too:
Fordid I sleep under this yew till now?

FLORIZEL:
No: O, let him swear by act of law
That I do remember: 'tis cowardice
To call a guilty man. Camillo and the shoots
You do remember already are the same,
same you have worn; and you'll bear you
In right.

LEONTES:

KING LEWIS XI:
This is your speeding report; of 'tis Scales
From three to four.

LEONTES:
We thank you, lad, and to't.

Lord:
Most free, most!

LEONTES:

Do't and speak; you are free,
If you be my brother or my sister.

Lord:
I would they knew my purpose.

LEONTES:
My lord,
She came from Libya.

IA:
The worthy madman, had his just demands,
He could show himself, or spur a bolt,
Save burning honour, that his after-meed soul
see no more!

PAULINA:
Who knows not where else?

EMILIA:
The gods of soldiers,
His multiplying enemies,
And our friends with our friends.

LEONTES:
Thou, he does me half, to-day.

ESCALUS:
That's a poor report;
His soldiers', like an usurer,
Thy fame, past all touch'd.

PAULINA:
That's to me,
From one 'scold, that lies
In the stocks.

LEONTES:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to your knee,
Who least will touch him.

ANTIGONUS:
The gods of soldiers, i' the treaty,
And known 'tis not the arm of your
To lie and take all the sceptre of the sceptre.

LEONTES:
Thou chid'st me rage: I'll not endure
The bruising of the gods; and turn the word,
No, to my own disgrace with my life.
 Camillo was his adopted heir;
For what miscarries he, that did usurp
Your sceptre.

LEONTES:
Did I lay an ambush for your high deserts?

PAULINA:
You seem'd to us in the character of our most noble:
There it is.

LEONTES:
This is another grave.

PAULINA:
In sign of chastity well agree,
And better 'twere what youTHan.

LEONTES:
Shall we honour you with our thanks and these those
That you contentWe need.

PAULINA:
Who must that go?

EMILIA:
The grave is blessed for your majesty.

LEONTES:
And I am absolute in heart
To thank the gods.

LEONTES:
And to despair?
I pray you, call them fear'd and afraid.

ANTIGONUS:
I pray now, call them fear'd and free!

PAULINA:
Who call you?

EMILIA:
Your grace.

LEONTES:
To follow MONFar
Is the course of love, which else
Would be unparallel'd.

PAULINA:
Fairly offer'd;
This but a month since, were my brother Tybalt.

LEONTES:
A little love, his unstain'd hand
Of parting with the hand of war,
Were tongueless to all posterity.

PAULINA:
That hand of mine
Did ne'er make the leg of a slave's
More than my body's parting with my soul!
I will tear it with your knee,
And put on gloves of mine.

MONTAGUE:
What noise of waters in mine ears?

All those that I could were, were told
Might stop my ears.

COMINIUS:
Come, citizens:
We know you are come.

MONTAGUE:
Where's Montague?

COMINIUS:
The people of the people
======================================== SAMPLE 36 ========================================
This afternoon,
And shall this gear of mine armour on my shoulder
This night lie unsolable, and this small packet
Of Greek and Latin but? O, that once more I should meet
With tears of those that shall be encounter'd:
For cloth was my father timeless;
And for the present deed of York
Were to take all packthread from cats.
O boy! the beggar then comes the Duke of York,
and with him drew commands, how he did know
The noble Duke of York had no more forecast,
But, whiles he was higher than his proud-kind curse,
That all the sun could see his glory,
And had not splashed his sword,
The a passageable sword's black eye hath been blue,
That the poor cur is crimson in the king's blood,
And yet his neck, as big as any thing,
In all his deadly points kept on at once
Are plaints, prayers, loving fathers' blood,
The sternness of his frown'd cheeks,
The downrightness of his chin and cheek,
So wildly, to strike and gallant,
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up her power.
Such is the daughter of a king,
And this youthful man is it:
And as he is a man she is proud,
She is a made by man for the last,
Who has not a made- Jove but is
Who builds his hopes out ofable,
His oath enrolled in his thoughts,
And what is he that feeds his soul,
Wrenching his hopes from seeming,
But none of him to be ruled,
Lest his surrish rver'd with habit and charity,
Which were of no momentary,
The mightiest of his desires,
Among the infinite doings custom,
He come unto me,
Standing before a clergymen;
And had he been a chaite,
We might have been more pitiful.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, were it not pity he did show me;
I pity the him, and desire all emulation.
As that the malign'd Hastings did to us,
Came he not home to-night?

GLOUCESTER:
Where did he leave?

BUCKINGHAM:
At nine months old.

GLOUCESTER:
Even as we were,--

BUCKINGHAM:
Come, bring us to our holy task again.

DERBY:
To thrive, that we may strive
To yield the tenth by conquest.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll rest betide the weary way
To come and crush a body with a dangerous giving:
The hope thereof makes thee fearful.

BUCKINGHAM:
What means it, that thou mayst prove
To shame the soul with that which we all profess
To fight withal.

GLOUCESTER:
How, noble lord,--

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord!

GLOUCESTER:
How ill-boding, hateful lord,
Canst thou so bravely know the cause of that calamity?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I cannot tell: O, 'tis better fit,
Than to be crown'd by one that fixes
The root which he should to the root were unvalued
In the present deed. Ratcliff, his argues
To maintain 'gainst the day of law;
And therefore law shall notory draw from him these bitter names;
Meantime, law shall Rome make a law
To order the Duke of Clarence,
His youngest sister, to the English king,
Unto the queen of heavenly philosophy,
And this our heavenly face to walk
To the dead bodies:
God witness with that black scandal which thou stubborn'st,
I know, that from this world I have fought
With saints and holy men;
And, yet I am not bold to make my wars
To-morrow. Yet tell me, peace be with me!
What happy hour canst thou make
This Capitol break?

Lieutenant?

LARTIUS:
The difference of the moans and the people,
distinctly fought;
Not so big, but even so small as an English yeoman.
O, how the people's pleit!
O, that their hearts were cheap!

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll do this, or they smartly
That make it where it stands,
By this: yet, I'll do't: yet, to-morrow,
Tell me what blessings I can afford
In this our quiet confines;
Unless, by sudden, my infant,
======================================== SAMPLE 37 ========================================
 fair seem'd,
First to crave, and my daughter--lo, fool again!--
She whom I, his angry soul--
Didst send him so to liking!
Where did he leave?

PAULINA:
At that sad stop I heard him call'd.
Marry, a very says he is coming.
How now! what mean'st thou to this?

EMILIA:
At the nuptial level of this present deed,
Where I supposed you were tied in descent;
And now to 't.

PAULINA:
The very trick on't.

EMILIA:
To bid a wife
So sweet to rest and reign as 'twere
A daughter of the king's entreaties.

PAULINA:
Well, you must go visit the accused in your hate,
And whatsoever you do or talk with him.

EMILIA:
no, not a whit: what you must prove
In a lady's chamber where you donight
Shall your chamber and music shall go.

PAULINA:
I will tell him what I can tell him.

EMILIA:
He shall be my wife; I will prepare
To fatify his blood, his teeth shall let me live,
And I with all expedient duty see you.
I fear, my liege,--

PAULINA:
What! lack I told you when I did hear
The prince my brother had not himself show'dhip to the world,
He was more worth a noble man than me?

EMILIA:
No, my good lord;
For I have heard him say and swear
That he did not suffer me: yet I'll hear no more.
I would to were known by our gracious lord.

PAULINA:
The good gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here!
I mean, my liege, the people'sions are grown
More and more inexorable than your common thoughts,
Which never comes well.

LEONTES:
He's coming.

EMILIA:
And is his noble mother not a woman's name?

EMILIA:
She is,
Though she be not a woman's nurse;
The worst is jealousy.

LEONTES:
Take your prayers with your prayers;
And visit them to-morrow:
We will for Ireland, when he is there.
Come, what is whence, whose designs the sad flag
To lie and take on him grows.

PAULINA:
We will, my lord.

LEONTES:
For I cannot lick it:
You must contrary me!

PAULINA:
Were best I should do,
I should the best.

LEONTES:
Well, 'tis honourable to resign.
How couldst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
Might in the precedent,
On so just cause?

EMILIA:
To waste it, and not having the power to do,
For what he did I did, I'll let myself
Give to another, or this: to this end,
I wish't.

LEONTES:
Was he used to, and how 'twas,
When he did need ere he could put his power to death,
He had not justly therefore 'tis need'd
For what so great a man.

PAULINA:
Great sir,
We must have a holy father's daughter come.
What needs the king to-day?

EMILIA:
A child, and a child,
Lives not to cousin but his natural guiltiness,
By too cruel means.
What needs the king to-day?

EMILIA:
But 'tis my deserving; and they are
My deserving not.

LEONTES:
Thy brother is dead, or they are almost slain in.

PAULINA:
I cannot tell:
So his fault is, but I must be
I judge by the good judge, or thy jealous jealous.

EMILIA:
Your oath is of an oath, and that is your grace:
The duty that we have made you do we do,
The duty that we have made you do, and that we have
Our right, to come to you.

LEONTES:
Pass, and go about with us;
We'll to Westminster,
To see these things humbly now.

First Lord:
God save your brother's life!

PAULINA:
Give me joy, to see these triumphs!

CAPULET:
We thank you, gentle

 for the dowry, as 'twere i' the Capitol,
Or what is o'clock, I cannot tell.
I must therefore take my leave of you, gentle son,
and homely with my thoughts.
Methinks I see your brows are full of discontent,
Your smiles like an you have been
Set in stone: I cannot with
conscience take it yet.

KING RICHARD II:
If 'gainst thine accords,' 'twas by no means
To make prescription for another benefice:
The gifts I have given I have,
Shall bear and you are too mighty.

Clown:
Take it to the custom, thou but directly
Show duty.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will look to your brow, and let them gaze on me
As I judge Your good or bad:
O, take it from me, 'twas pity of your majesty,
My rather I would have been more pitiful.

KING RICHARD II:
O, I pray, take it from thee,
Who being the supreme King of kings,
Thy grandfather's earth, where indeed
There is my gage, that is rotten
As ever in the history of man.

Clown:
If I had been remember'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her pretty foot, her eye. Come, son, take it;
Take it up straight: thou diest, thou mayst.

KINGRICHARD II:
O, brother, will't please your majesty
To prick thy finger, though thou art malapert?

CLown:
My lord, I cannot tell: Sir Pierce, 'tis for policy,
The forter of the climate.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, thou caitiff on dispatch
Those things, which Edward knows,
Let him know ease.

CLown:
If she please to come to shrift, what dost thou do
Still to my tent, the gods will hear
The happy tidings abroad.

KING RICHARD II:
Tell me, thou gentle son,
What gracious regent, and holy thoughts I hear
My liege you say. I love the king,
God he knows I dearly love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Come hither, England's ground.

KING RICHARD II:
Where did you leave?

BUCKINGHAM:
At nine.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, so it was, my lord.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, we pardon you this: but I cannot tell;
The king's will not be cross in talk:
The thought of Bolingbroke outweighs my right:
Because that you knew my father,
Because you respected him.

KING RICHARD II:
But, o' God's name, I do not well.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I cannot tell:
My brother is on the forces of your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
He is appointed king of England;
And as is the fortune of this land,
Accountant to the English king and queen.
I fear, that he will sooner show himself
To the people than on a day desire.

BUCKINGHAM:
I cannot tell:
Pardon me, Margaret, but you will be king.

KING RICHARD II:
Where have I thought you are in your grace?
When you were then in Holborn,
The king were cruel and jealous,
Intoldly show'd, drunken, reckless, marvellous,
To monarch unprepared, and unto the hazard
Of much frowning.
I would to God, my lord
To bless my lord from his fear'd,
Which now concerns me not.

QUEEN:
What, with my heart! sweet mother!
Thou art my mother's ally;
And thou with a grim looks deny her name,
Which was your part, of no moment,
To make my queen a sword of France.

QUEEN:
What haste, widow! where haste?
When I was first,'t brave father,
Those men so fond as we revel'd,
That I am thus long without your tricks,
You take it not amiss me;
My stops to passion, and MEASURE.

CLIFFORD:
Alas poor Clarence did forsake!

YORK:
'Twas haste that brought you; it even now.

KING RICHARD II:
Out, devil! I remember it to my grief,
And, now I bear it, to tear it apart,
Which you, mother

O, spare us not!
The king your brother hath lost himself,
His name of fault and Daughter's departure.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him revenge me to me,
Where I may be pleasing and in fair duty,
By Him that I am his father.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of him.

GLOUCESTER:
The shame that I have, by heaven,
Divides not with me.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The doubt he swears, when he heard
The noble tribunes seem'd, was not provoked
To hear Cominius speak himself.

GLOUCESTER:
That was when, and withal
He had no equal.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Blind sight, dead coz,Woe's dire flag!
And the child begnaoth the male slave
To be by oath enjoin'd and enjoin'd!
The holy mark of justice,
That we may do ill by force and fraud,
Shall win the day after, and be dogified
With daily prayers all of worthy warriors,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
Myself cannot tell;
And, to conclude with truth,--
I pray thee, peace:
Pray God, I with you, my neighbours,
To make me happy in your unity.

BUSHY:
I have not used it, in those preferments
Which are not the cause of love.

Boy:
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When you shall know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
Beseeching him for their vulgar virtue:
If he be his judge, why, there's some pity
Seconded by your desires: thatThose poor informal latrees here
Which you fancy more than any other.

Lord:
Go to, go to;
Pray God, and get our persons to the king,
And we will to sanctuary till we come.

Huntsman:
Will not you go, will you go with me?

GLOUCESTER:
Chop off my head ere you can say 'Ay.'

BUSHY:
Why, 'tis my will, the will of heaven,
Meantime, ere I can say.

GLOUCESTER:
If I were thy will and not thy will,
Yet that ere I will be any where I have my wish,
To be, by Him, by Him I desire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What says he? will he not stumble?

GLOUCESTER:
Will he not stumble? will he not fall down,
Since you must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorish custom,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Under your canopy, I heard you;
Your friends are up, and buckle
Repair'd upon your bosom.

GLOUCESTER:
Your presence makes us rich, I most need
To help you to your curse:
Your strength is but frail of all your points,
That you are thus germane'd by your means.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thank you, gentle uncle,
That I may enter next I can
To curse the offenders.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
When I were a little lord, I'ld hear him speak.

GLOUCESTER:
He cannot but with mildness
Attake our justice, and put his own son
In mind the tender George: then, after God,
He leaves us to repose his disposition,
Which never brooked, but to be quite away.

Lord:
God give your grace happy hours of joy!
Aumerle, thou weep'st to see this day.

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow, then, the fearful day
Of death's violence shall be seen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To-morrow: what fearful man is this
That with the child he so troubles your grace!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Be ruled by him.

======================================== SAMPLE 40 ========================================
 amorous Clifford;
Report of fashions in arms,
How in seeming pale!

CLIFFORD:
What I do know; and my dear lord,
Do me this lesson, to know my mind.
If no lord tell me, 'tis by no means valiant Clifford;
Our brother is right, and we'll sure win him.
Staff-hire steel grows soft as spring'st:
From Scotland am I stol'n, being but young:
If e'er again I meet him, by every syllable
Tullus Marcius shall disinherit me:
Because of that, I know, O, he is all
Right.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, thou nothing; thou a son,
Dicinable as the son is, He does appear,
Like to their morning:
O, belike he is as true as steel.

CLIFFORD:
No doubt his majesty will be content to these jest.
But follow me, he will more show me what a face
is this night: as often headlongs
Among fresh female buds shall he stand
at a vineyard:
If I were his adopted heir, or just by my word,
I heard him say, he would be content:
He said to me, and I saw him.

YORK:
'Tis thought the king is dead;
And all the sceptres are fled to him.

WARWICK:
So thought the king; and all are fled to him:
As it is dead to men, I hear he say,
That murder me for the grave:
If he do take me ten thousand men
To name myself, 'tis by:
If he be slaughter'd, I cannot tell,
If him so foul as is the hag.

YORK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
She whom here we have sworn to weed and plough'd,
She were as unhoving as the king,
That Henry had no more forecast,
When Oxford had me down:
And wheresoe'er we be, we'll make
Our way more short, to cross the seas.

MONTAGUE:
Oxford will never be too young for our age.

EDWARD:
What wrong, man, this kind of brotherhood
Touches me too fast, and therefore hath he too mean
To prick thy finger, his neck under thy arm,
My will to my grave: and therefore hath he too
Exposed to appear, and, in my rage,
To monarchize, and in the base of many kings.
I will to my castle, to be
Who thus I may gather to, to be, ere I sleep.

RICHARD:
What noise is this? Give me leave: I will follow thee.

WARWICK:
What curious eye is this to this relation, lords?

RICHARD:
An eye, sweet lady, or a bloody eye,
That can better brook the handling:
And yet the steer, the heiferous object,
The which we perform, we'll cross to the dirt
Where the worser is lying,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
Heaven and honour! what honour, shall I have
The thanks and strength of my being one?
Aumerle, thou weep'st, and I'll still live.

RICHARD:
No, wrangling woman, we'll none on our doom.

CLIFFORD:
May my knees grow to the earth's cold face
And never brook retreat: descend my hands.

YORK:
I'll leave my kingly-sweet consent to his.

EDWARD:
No, marry, sir, not fast; commanded,
Not how to take and practise by myself.
Methinks I see your brows are full of discontent,
Your smiles put I unto your suits,
Some mock you have with manner how you in your brow
Might stop my practise, and my mind
Still better than I had it before.

EDWARD:
Let no man mock me, I am thus bold with him.

YORK:
Sweet widow, hear me, lords; and I will kiss your boy.

KING HENRY VI:

CLIFFORD:
If 'twere but one thing to take and cut another,
I willix the earth to the King of France again:
Why, then 'tis mine, and we will.

CLIFFORD:
King Henry, I kiss your children' feet
As
======================================== SAMPLE 41 ========================================
'd and sworn.

DUKE OF BERLE:
Every oath is but to command a word or two:
Besides, every word's superfluity,
And therefore take an oath to yield to another.

ISABELLA:
We will walk, my lord.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I cannot move your majesty:
Under penalty, as you may,
I come to use my wings.

ISABELLA:
I do not change my disposition:
May your sworn duty, and I'll do what duty,
Do what you can, and I'll be my sworn fellow;
And I'll no more double meed to one jot.

DUKE OFORANTIGONUS:
Me too, my lord.

ISABELLA:
To give again: thou must think to grant it then,--
Withal! it is too rash, too boisterous,
To give again; to grant it then,
When it doth.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Look, sir! how sweet an oath it is!
Within two hours, Marcius, and Montague,
Come Lammas, come Lammas-trees in your pomp,
To strew three zodiacs, and I am fain
To blot out the bottom of my corn.

MENENIUS:
No, take more:
If you do take it not patiently,
But with the will of the gentry,
Then 'tis my policy
To strike him to the base.

BRUTUS:
He cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame
To strike at him when he did so well.

MENENIUS:
If I were as well under than you are here,
'Tis for the inheritance of my name:
Being by and by, I cannot more remember
Than you are by to keep my name:
 Trust, I would ye were here.

BRUTUS:
Well, I know
The people will not be any more
But such a one as you are.

MENENIUS:
 you'll fame to a grave
By this your free person's repetition.

BRUTUS:
'Tis not to me, I tell you,
But to your inheritance and your due by birth,
Where is the life that you are, are loath:
Mine is called upon you; and my name is
The grave of your majesty.

MENENIUS:
If that come short, you'll leave your honours
To help Cominius.

COMINIUS:
I pray now, come after:
Dear brother, think toio, what requital of your loves,
Can we devise, but not make you ready
Before you have your time of storm.

 Rome, and with high looks, and with his royal hand,
Doth make us tremble.

MENENIUS:
Consider this:
We'll make our stand, and so ruteous,
To ready our disposition, as our lives.

COMINIUS:
Away! let's home.


MENENIUS:
Thus we'll home to Rome.

BRUTUS:
You'll know our mind.

COMINIUS:
But, as they thought to stay,
Should be so rashly coloured:
Pray God, I once more return'd my word.

MENENIUS:
Refused you, Marcius?

BRUTUS:
Mended us not.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let's home.

COMINIUS:
I pray you, call them again.

CORIOLANUS:
The noble tribunes cannot do it to shame.
When will he try his hoacy in Corioli,
Will he so soon meet for joy of action,
And ill-boding tongue deliver him so ill.

MENENIUS:
Hail, Marcius!
He's more than idly, than over-kind to be
Whoop'd by the litter.

COMINIUS:
Look your ladys!

MARCIUS:
A little more o that.

SICINIUS:

A partial slander sought I to avoid;
And most guilty of my love.

MENENIUS:
We had but two in the house, which at the very
gentle point of shame,
The which he painted over with painted imagery,
Came I servant of the rich embroider'd king;
Who of his country name he named me Autolycus;

Lord:
Then, LordHark! our gentle lord--

GLOUCESTER:
Lord Salbot, they have consider'd in our counsels
Their late presbration: your counsel's digest'd.

Messenger:
The contents discover!

GLOUCESTER:
The king's will be our friend, and yet his successor
Shall be London sent to every one.

CLARENCE:
What is't your will owe your good stars,
And the loss of the great Lord Henry's right?
The king is not his friend nor himself.

GLOUCESTER:
That fair fellow is the Duke of York.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And why, we thought no less,
When he did the thing he did, when he did
Think you did. When we were sure
That Phaethon should have benefice,
But that the next heir, being pent from liberty,
Anon had dishered that with his which
He did to look.

GLOUCESTER:
Where were you born, friend?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Here in Vienna; I now back'd with welcome home.
And to our unknown pleasure are to importune,
The tongue'st to our old desire.

GLOUCESTER:
The aim of Vienna is alive,
And we his policy to come to crave,
Happily when it stands with him.

Where have you thought you he would attend us?

QUEEN MARGARET:
To pity him, that thought it?

HASTINGS:
So did not I:
The thought of but for the thing I had in hand
Enforce'd so.

GLOUCESTER:
But did not I mind to be at pains
To prickle thus ere once?

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, master mayor?

GLOUCESTER:
E had you figured that pain,
To tear the pent-up lion o' the earth.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I would I had died a maid
And never seen you sorry!

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, did not I; it is better, lady,
Than to be pitied of thee. Come, let us shame you.
If you joy and need our loves, come down.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Come, we'lljust you down, down; loving not our care.

GLOUCESTER:
To be so bared and lock'd is to hear.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as my soul; but withal
Your desire. Consuming means,
For what I have said
You would not only givest me; but, to be
An open et caetera, I would be
Great jollieu, and to be no jier.

GLOUCESTER:
But you will
find me that enough.

BUCKINGHAM:
You will not?

GLOUCESTER:
That shall I say?

BUCKINGHAM:
I will be noble, and I'll be content:
I know, and have been familiar with my friends.

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient, gentle lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who is't that is your husband
To the child of Your mother?

GLOUCESTER:
Your husband, I warrant you,--

QUEEN MARGARET:
What is your child?

GLOUCESTER:
A aged widow's lady,
And by some unlook'd accident cut her head off.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Romeo! 'twas born too.

GLOUCESTER:
What, art thou madam?

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear me not; it is not my child
Who hath lain these two days awake.

GLOUCESTER:
By my child,
Fear me not: 'tis born long.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Boy, therefore, let's see:
The precedent was when young Ned and the brothers
Were stol'n upon their backs.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, then it is yours.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Had it been a shame to conceal our true meaning
Howin noble cousin, at the feet
Of What we two mean to look upon,
======================================== SAMPLE 43 ========================================

?

All:
Lascivious gifts, lad, freely consented
By you perform'd; and let me tell you
I am your sovereign.

WARWICK:
Why, 'tis a shame;
And, as I am a king, how can you curse
That I may curse the very victory?
If not by doing, by proper means,
If by surfeit.

KING HENRY VI:
If I be not, I'll give my jewels for
Their future benefit: I have forsworn
The barren sceptre of the sceptre,
Where I am loath to be so bold in mine arms.

WARWICK:
I have no more shoes than feet; and I'll re
one the more feet.

KING HENRY VI:
What! will you not on me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:
Why, son, I cannot tell; for I'll hammer you
in the next degree; I'll moan them dry,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
Where ever you tread'd on sickly rocks.

EDWARD:
Mount you, my lord.

MONTAGUE:
To help menow, it is needful:
Madam, as we are busied about,
Where shall we all determine
Our happy tidings on the journey?

Messenger:
To-morrow, or there been talk'd of,
If you should be so very cruel,
'Tis in the slave's mind.

YORK:
Your pleasure is, as I thought,
bawd; your brother cruel son:
He cannot choose. is the madest thing?

MONTAGUE:
If to be so cruel,
'Tis to get him; I will not be cruel.

YORK:
Give me no pity, I pray thee.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Be patient, gentle father; I will show myself a tyrant:
Hear me one word;
Baredly by his angry eye, even as bad,
As I did him; but even as those with,
That cannot but show himself, but will
Lest I would be so too cruel.

YORK:
O brother, I respected before him;
Since you respected with him.

KING HENRY VI:
So must you to this?

MONTAGUE:
To show him my duty, and perform a ceremonious duty,
And perform an honourable duty to your majesty.

WARWICK:
What, is Clarence dead? or is it not hard?

CLARENCE:
To help him to his new-made bride
AndRelease his ensuing heir, as if
Condemn'd to be or Clarence?

YORK:
More of him anon.

KING HENRY VI:
What, you are there, butcher?

CLARENCE:
Why, how now, Clarence!Speak to me;
Recover breath, and make foul work!

CLARENCE:
To see this knack, how you can you drum
Against the hard hearts!

YORK:
We'll tarry till we came; the bridegroom took
To see this knack, and her fellows murdered.

KING HENRY VI:
God hold we need strong and that!

YORK:
The widow's champion in my story,
And he should have married Juliet.

CLARENCE:
Thanks, foolish boy; my father, thanks.

WARWICK:
What mercy the absent duke had, when he said,
He swung about his hag design;
Fasten'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very tired.

YORK:
Where is the Duke of York had encounter'd him?

EXETER:
When last we were up, we heard he were heard
heard of aUMurn.

YORK:
He said, I heard him say, and vauntingly replied,
'Yea,' quoth he, in what?

EXETER:
Such be the jacks fair within.

WARWICK:
Sweet father, the Duke of York is slain,
And the gates, that we heard of!

YORK:
And that 'why,' quoth he; as many soars and bleeks before him,
When he did stand aloof, and charged like a guard,
He should have run'd my horse to death,
And that the dying cries did run
From the noise of our desire.

That Clifford's manhood lies upon my tongue
And that our England's ground beuteous,
And death's pale flag is called upon our royal king?
O, thou England's ground, thy ancient thoughts,
Or thy glory, thou wisest.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
I have heard, but not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing I cannot,
O, that I were a lord ofSuch.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us happy hours,
and smooth the frowns of such a goodly father.
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
That led calm Henry, but not so,
As some doth a sail, pursued by the waves,
To cross the seas, whence once more strike'd.
Drinking'st thou that his helm is not hoar ere it be green;
The helm, and, often thus waving,
May call upon thee.

WARWICK:
How! with a heart so qualified as his soul.

YORK:
O, let's hear him speak. O o' my mouth, or my heart!
If I cannot by name to know,
Come victory, gracious Richard.

KING HENRY VI:
I think his happy words bewitch'd;
'Tis but his policy
To sunder his sings and his appetite in me.

YORK:
O, let me speak.

KING HENRY VI:
If they do that feat,
O, let them make me proud with words,
And carry with me still my envy's steel;
I'll be revenged on thee.

YORK:
'Twas an oath thatbreaker's the law of death to me.

KING HENRY VI:
The holy mother, proud Plantagenet,
That princely father, at the very feet
Of my conception,
Hath sent two of thy brother to safeguard
Thyself and these thy sceptres were at liberty.

YORK:
He's a traitor, perorny; and that
Which they upon the very siege of my glory.

KING HENRY VI:
The duty that he owes to your majesty
I seal upon the lips of mortal men,
The duty that I have, to safeguard thine own life,
The duty that I have, to safeguard thine own children,
Shall follow to London, to be crown'd England's king:
And, if we do, promise the queen of us
And our fair daughter shall be quit the gage
Of great King Henry,
Who had no more forecast,
But, whiles he thought to steal from the Tower,
And, if we joy, we'll leave the court.

KING HENRY VI:
Let us stand to our fortune and be gone
To keep the court and do our duty.

YORK:
Now bear truths to the court.

WARWICK:
What is Edward but ruthless sea?

Messenger:
The melancholy king of the where he stands,
Bound with an argosy to the hilt
In every loyal man's mood.

YORK:
If that our right hand would buy two hour's life,
That I could yield my life off in pursuit,
Then 'twere pity.

KING HENRY VI:
O, but he's as true as I.

WARWICK:
Suppose, that I by this league
 am attended at the cypress grove:
Besides, he is famous for the grave of kings;
His close duty tenderly therefore shall be locked'd
My soldiers for this smooth discourse.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who knows not he is your enemy?

Messenger:

And perform'd by your alliance before I came.

KING HENRY VI:

Sir John Ramston, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint;
Who attended at your marches but we look'd not of the malice
Of the poor but most hasty my troop.

You mean not wed to-morrow,
To entreat the Lady Bona and the son
To come at Ludlow, by your leave to London:

How many, how many children and how age

Yet never means for life so long come to do
To prick the finger of ten thousand years.

To lable flower of temperance.

YORK:

Fortune and victory sit throne,
On a high and mighty body.

YORK:
I thank your majesty, for this thought of mine.

Lord:
But I cannot rest
To think my soul's recompense'd with any jot:
Sweet York, sweet husband, I cannot think
So twenty years together: I'll lean
To one place, another, and remain so still winter
To this night.

Why, you want not: Farewell, farewell: what presence must not there

CLARENCE:
About some unborn, or Nature, changed:
'Tis thought the king is a woman and was
That talk'd of a beastly Richard.'

YORK:
'Tis thought the king is a child of mine:
That is not so.

CLARENCE:
If any of you think so, 'tis by

Words, life and all are Death's stamp,
That is, life.

For my short date of breath is stopp'd with bloody cries:

His noble duty, as mistaken all this while
He duty day in duty, and perform a tyrant,
Even in the vesture of virtue.

WARWICK:
No more!

KING HENRY VI:
When I and nature make the pastime light,
When you shall lay the power of yourself,
Then I and men are no soldiers;
If youON with men you see them,

If you think you'll hang them on your high pay.

WARWICK:
Thereon I stood,
Even with those jades.

O, take this yielding, thou curst unto my will;
Or, if thou do'st, being satisfied:
Let's withdraw till we return.

SOMERSET:
Let's to our fortune.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, success makes me rich, and I'ld love.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
If heaven prevent, and our life's condition
Stire with our children' moan.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
Can't please your highness to resolve me now?
I rather do not have my life off hence,
At home, where I do remain.

KING EDWARD IV:
I'll rather show myself a tyrant
Than one of you with our father's veins.

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
What, can your highness say to me?

KING EDWARD IV:
The brat, I know, and will believe me.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot do it without your tricks: you must think you
Me'ldrew and tear; and that succession prorade

PRINCE EDWARD IV:
Well, I must do't:
Prithee, let me.

KING EDWARD IV:

GLOUCESTER:
Thou art perfect then, our blood
Hath been drawn and buried.

KING EDWARD IV:

GLOUCESTER:
Look, noble lord,--

PRINCE EDWARD:
Beseech your highness, and the queen's name there
Peering in your frown your husband, you see:
Meest and I, to be so muddy,
Shall stumble burthen your hearts
And never to come a better.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Where is my husband now? where are his children?

GLOUCESTER:
Here.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A better husband's life were far from one
Than that I have: odds twice two and two husband's children
Would ean one e'er I took you.

GLOUCESTER:
Your husband's life is only safest in his child;

 When we were last in Holborn,
'Tis thought
That, Duke of Clarence, shall we see
The happy tid of his disposition.

GLOUCESTER:
That we might, were he my brother's hope,
Or that he were, being some other
Which after holiday cannot think himself
Till time lend counsel and fair aid.

LORD FITZWATER:
If I were not in my mind
The soldiers shall tell me.

GLOUCESTER:
Such pity as my looks
When I show'd sourly,
Came he not home to-night?

LORD FITZWATER:
Right.

GLOUCESTER:
Where he did stay, I'll hear that conjecture,
Methinks he could bear himself
As far as to a vast,
 sea and land.

BUSHY:
That is no worse, to wish him well,
Until eating and drinking of his country.

GREEN:
If he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.

BUSHY:
Desp, let's not.

GLOUCESTER:
Then I hope, no coal-black,
For yet my rest
Takes my country's bow:
If I perniciously revolt,
Carry my words.

BUSHY:

'Tis pity.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis pity.

BUSHY:
I cannot tell:
'Tis fear the worst, to wail.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, let's home.

BUSHY:
If you will not, we'll frown and brawl;
The bruit thereof will bring you
To the bay.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell:
We must be gone. There will some form,
More than the common people's, and their thanks
To faithful service of your majesty.

BUSHY:
He'll not sleep in company.

GLOUCESTER:
If so thou think'st, yet I'll lean
To the enemy.

BUSHY:
Think'st thou that he will sure run mad?

GLOUCESTER:
 sure, some.

BUSHY:
Confirmity must not know.

GLOUCESTER:
Hush, an't like his.

BUSHY:
One that does not belong to me,
Has cause to hateful duty.

GREEN:
What think'st thou, and that will not be
If he were known before we were when
Proportion'd.

BUSHY:

Pardon me, my lord. Farewell: yet, fare ye well:

And in the longer term of his chastity.

GLOUCESTER:

These were his words: yet, they were short
Of late strong and sometimes begg'd.

BUSHY:

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis grace indeed.

BUSHY:

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean me from the way
Who made the Dauphin and the French king?
A boy, I warrant him.

GLOUCESTER:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord upper mess of blood doth bear him:
That which they are, the lord's fault is always
To the corruption of a by-doing:
Envious quarrel, how may man the Duke of York
To execute and jest at his pleasure?

If thou wilt take order Buckingham be with you
To make a shower and drown the rest with leaden tears,
Pray God thou go to the orange or mill.

Shall I be to pure man, I'll give him thanks,
As cruel majesty, by thee to break our necks.

ENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, swear not this hard-hearted man,
The man is as like as I was when I woo'd him;
That scars make no mourning widows for my death;
The want of any kind of mourning widows:
Under my mourning weeds I'll shroud myself;
I wear my willow garland for Edward's sake;
But hearts can never brook retreat from the presence.

KING RICHARD II:
O Hereford, I have dreamt--
That fear to climb crown by murdering me!
This fearful cousin, Warwick, that told me once,
 told me once again I should smile he could not,
When Clifford shook his sword at him;
'When he did face the flail and did sigh,
That mock'd me, our lord.
O Margaret, I have lost a part,
Which by the remembrance of my young cousin's death,
Who pass'd, as swiftly as the posts could run
Had return'd an ear to my cross-al'd:
But there is no point in base opinion,
To win the day of bloody strokes with him;
Who is it? the worst is not revenge sufficient
To win the day after war.

KING RICHARD II:
Faith, I hear many friends near.
Bushy, what news from this post?

BUSHY:
Mine earls cannot brook delay the word:
My horse fells by the dirt with the dirt;
And yet his fall'd by the dirt
My master riding behind my mistress' horse:
She melted past all day, and am I guer
To prick thy finger, nor Nature never injured:
Trust me, she melted into air. Affrighted many friends,
Whilst she did, as some hope,
Might in the ground be closed and her yields to me.
I cannot but to rejoice, any wrinkle more.
O Henry, she is as true as steel,
As Henry the Sixth hath.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet, on his right, and he rose
To harder bosoms!

GLOUCESTER:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.

RICHARD II:
Away! let it come, that you may ride's
With me to my deserts and to my closet
Where all my forces are?

WARWICK:

KING RICHARD II:
The bruit thereof
Would fetch you first to a root of nobly
Shall I be buried.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot but
Confirm the crown to my liege.

KING RICHARD II:
When is my son, then,
Where is my father, and how
I am his adopted heir;
But where my body is, and my thoughts are humble
Are to excuse me to this exercise,
Where, on my brother's grave, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My father named me father by my brother;
And now 'tis called content:
Besides, I heard the news;
And yet, to conclude that truth,
If these articles were true, 'twas good or false,
Our brother brother brotherwhom wedita,
That did bear a fork'd branch and laurel crown,
Which we scepters call friends to.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have thrice perforce than can your faith promise-breaker.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the entreating;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustiege you in the bloody seas.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:

NORTHUMBERLAND:

And by my wife; for this is wonderful.

CLARENCE:
It makes the devil look so pale,
That Henry will not live.

KING HENRY VI:
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No: yet, as we may,
Our grandsire and these gentlemen
You sought to displace the throne, and as we thought
To call this goodly Duke of York
And where his uncle did stand possess'd;
I and have known since that he did show me frown:
And wheresoe'd, our tent,
Since that our man made way;
And say'd revengeful pity for it.

YORK:
O, give me leave! I will follow thee down.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who meets us here?

KING HENRY VI:
Where where's your lord, where's my spleen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
To make high majesty look like itself,
And iframercies, be rough with iron.

KING HENRY VI:
Remember, as thou read'st, I did but look
To get a name to call the king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Whate'er I read to remember,
So I long to hear no other.

KING HENRY VI:
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I am past my brother, farewell:
Six years we banish him to our territories.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Cousin of Exeter,--

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet father, at what?

QUEEN MARGARET:
To prick thy finger, being pent to despair,
And come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
Be not too hasty to confound.

KING HENRY VI:
Shall we call back Northumberland. Tell Richmond this:
To-morrow will it please your majesty
To come and hear our disposition.

QUEEN MARGARET:
To-morrow, then, behold,
What day you do me: pray you, let me know
What you do me, and what I strive
To come upon thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, I do not mind the delay:
May it please your majesty,
To come more and what you make.

QUEEN MARGARET:
May it please your majesty, to resolve me now;
Where'er you, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to:
If she have any hand, as sharp as the chair
On this apparent quarrels him.

WARWICK:
Mine, or this sword, or what
That we will share,
Were not to be talked as near as on the common people,
But to be to them on their sovereign.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, then,--
I pray thee, peace.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me live, and I hope I him well.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yonder comes the Lord Aumerle.

KING HENRY VI:
The king, I pray thee, and these his friends are
To make the king the secret harbour of this molehill-

Once more, good mother, in the day of battle:
I was not budge for take way,
But gracelessly by sudden of the elements,
Who scarce senses of what they did know
Did know so heinous, and therefore should they
Match not the sleeping rheum, which the mutinous flag
Was contrary to all posterity.
Therefore, with a bonny eye, I spy a kind of face,
Being movedable and afflictable to all posterity,
Yet had not our spirit, will our bodies were warmer
Than these poor accords.
To mingle them to mine thoughts I did see
In them: were they to be ruled, my lord
Mould be my vice in them, and not my kind of man
Bes history.

Come, cousin you must go visit the Capitol.

Who now are wheres and whom their names call
Against the wind and waves but mean for they appear as they speak
To several subjects held their peace
In Ross and areBeards of resort to him.
Fair lords, take leave and part; for 'tis a brother
That were himself, were he not so resolved,
He was not at your pleasure.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, 'twas my name,
My manly honour, by your leave:
By this and all the rites of knighthood else,
Have I appellant to this princely Duke,
Where to he should find you lions, finds you hare;
And happy were you for that;
If I could reach him, I had been withal.
To him! you scarcely know his mind of me:
Perhaps I am not to blame his.
That I desire revenge and therefore pardon him:
Pardon me, and he shall not suffer me:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the heaping sighs I did yield to him;
Yea, and at that I being king,
And yet 'tis no other:
Moreland, thou churl where the Englishman is dead,
And that is little peevish.

QUEEN:
Nine changes of the colour hath been used;
Besides, I was careful;
For scarce any thing would, between us,
Once.

GREEN:
We thank you, gentle Earl of March,
And know howsoon to come; therefore follow me.


KING RICHARD II:
Had I been a prophet by the Lord Northumberland,
How doth the world frown as we thought.

QUEEN:
Three changes of the substance, of nothing,
In such a thought of mine.

GREEN:
That thought,
And so did I, I mistake myself:
Think you, but that I had been thus myself,
Or that have been more true which I am,
Than all of that thought of.

RICHARD II:
That thought, madking,
Beseech you, hear me but one word:
Let that pass, and go about with me.

KING RICHARD II:
O Thou be patient, gentle Earl of March:
What is thy name, or what art thou,
Shall we be keen in our tackles?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If that pass be, 'tis by four.

KING RICHARD II:
Whom should that be? belike, therefore it is so.

QUEEN:
Ratcliff! my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
My name boy.

QUEEN:
My lord?

KING RICHARD II:
Not that I name it, but in the last.

QUEEN:
Plainly some other chase.

KING RICHARD II:
Get you hence; I will away to-night.

QUEEN:
But awake, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
What's your opinion of debating? A few of that looks
To twenty dives, cares not.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That fellow is foolish, as I report.

RICHARD:
Little show'd, but not show'd, so it can
Put fingerthread'd from the sword.

KING RICHARD II:
What, art thou hurt?

Darest thou not suffer me? thou shall not suffer me:
By your good prayer I may not be angry;
For all the cause heaven o'er-morrow
Give way unto-day.

QUEEN:
I do believe thee, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that eye thee, it will detest
The ordering of the mind too cruel,
For every Troy hath soars ere he stood up
Against Christ's dear blood,
As here it is.

EDWARD:
Sweet widow! how do you thank my lord,
As thou seest me, in the mighty hour
That e'er I heard me on the earth;
But, after my death, I must up-fill this osier cage
Of shame and great moment. O, think my deep prayers
From those that I often have heard
Shall grace me, and desire all good days of discontent
To un myself, of thee and these poor children:

Upon remainder of a dear account,

Nor can I blame him. Come, ladies, go.

GLOUCESTER:
Your will not suffer me; for I will follow thee.

YORK:
Your will not endure him. Nay, now I see
These arms that he spun from Ulysses.

GLOUCESTER:
O, let me say, good madam.

YORK:
'Tis the will of majesty, come.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll report by secret means,--
And will you go too?

YORK:
Shall we hear from us, but will we hear from whence we have begun?

GLOUCESTER:
To triumph, if so be not so?

YORK:
What! would the king had slept again.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, I would he had!

YORK:
Why, therefore let me live.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, you must hear from me, or else
Shall I walk abroad, my lord.

YORK:
What, shall we go?

GLOUCESTER:
To help our mistress! Come.

YORK:
Who knows I had rather be a husband or a wife
Than a poor weak and veryboding wife.

GLOUCESTER:
Lord! thou know'st not where you are.

YORK:
From your good report of him, it follows;
That I may better play the idle orator,
As one that you are.

GLOUCESTER:
Leave me, and tarry, and play with Clarence,
For I am taken offence.

YORK:
Anthony Woodville, you mistake the matter;
And your mistake is of an inforced countenance,
To be whilst shame should dwell
In what is next to what is first,
Shall we follow this sentence of your majesty,
Which will be so much honoursable.

GLOUCESTER:

First, madam, indeed, I would be content:
Prove it, thou, that I affects it.

YORK:
I would not presume but to conceal what lies after:
I am content to look on you. Come, ladies, go.
That I may turn our hate, being the wound
Of our big heart. Eyes, look your last!
 lip, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou love's grace, bound with the farthest farthest wind
Ne'er truer breath, will not whatie,
Shall say, nay, and use the word.

CLARENCE:
O brother, thou art too malapert:
I should by my count be hours,
And I should live a thousand years, or 'point to thee.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet father, by my state I do not know
What I have said belongs to thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
O, thou know'st my grief!

YORK:
The bed I made to for my death's parting,
Being whipt and in my grief, the shepherd's daughter,
And I, to soothe your souls:
Till then fair hope must I make
To come to thee, in the name of God.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of him.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Who does the hateful thing?

Messenger:
The devil.

YORK:
'Tis devils,
And these devils told me of.

GLOUCESTER:

Messenger:
So her promised to help you to be your common people.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
In what?

Messenger:
The holy mother, part with the child,
Vouchsafe, for your brother's sake.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Part with her, thou head and
Your sorrow's part with her: up, you know,
What you are doing in the time, but nothing
Of your noble presence.

To lay my bones in chains of black descent.

How now, fair gentle Warwick, and the haught insulting sun,
From this world's bounty, at home to France,
and the haught insulting eye this fair sun,
See this dispatch'd by the loving kiss of thereaths:
Sleeping and waking, fearful, mutinous,
All eyes of heaven and these eyes of man
Might not a jot at once?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who? that Plantagenet,
That forbids the posterns to gaze on him.

KING RICHARD II:
Anon!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, so strives this yielding to your grace:
That on Sunday next you shall haught and
Be satisfied: therefore, therefore, we'll ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

PRINCE EDWARD:
But I,
Anon!

YORK:
Ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
Bushy, what says the boy?

WARWICK:
But he, that told me of this boy,
When I supposed, when I had told him to
Speak of him, he had not look'd on me.

YORK:
Unless one by one fair word or two,
O fortune's worth as good deed!

WARWICK:
'Tis some thing too cruel, mad lord.

RICHARD:
Ay, another thing, to want,
And yet unavoided is this changeling lamb.

YORK:
I cannot tell; but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like to moths,
And yet we were all, as some would seem to,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
Yet had not we determined
To be full like those that encounter'd.

WARWICK:
Yet had not we determined he should win the day,
And that we hate the other side,
How would he gracious Richard!

EDWARD:
But shortly of his lip I tumbled from him;
'Tis but his policy to conceal his tongue.

WARWICK:
Thou know'st our duty, and, proud queen,
Makes him to smile as kings should.

YORK:
Be not king; for thou shalt not be so young.

KING RICHARD II:
We'll pay for our duty when our duty is accounted
Ourself knows the value of our own royal person.

WARWICK:
Too modest are you; and therefore, personally too,
To show so where you are sword to sword,
And hear, and in our quarrel,
How the one another best bade the other flourish.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of
What you are, were you me, and how
per friendly, were it to wound and stay,
For what your pleasure was, how he might,
Though you were not to be by oath,
At a determined scope,
To cross so fast duty, and still winter's tardy.

YORK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting boy,
Lord Warwick, and the haught insulting queen,
All these haught insulting boy,
And all your majesty, our brother Montague,
Among the haught heark your father achieved,
No humble suitors press'd, none, but that press'd,
To break our necks, asunder'd our helmets.
O Margaret, the mother of the world,
The world's black hand of death's majesty,
Hath made thy glory like itself,
Like the formal vice of lighthood.

EDWARD:
I think thee and these thy sons by marriage
Provely are these thy adopted heir.
Yet, unaccustom'd is this night,
To cease the idle pleasures of these Plantagenets,
Their loss of feasting hours,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and better than his.

If e'er you be he, 'tis by Berkeley,
That tempers are contrary,
To God of heavens and great hurt:
But, if you be so, lords.

To God of soldiers think of good Duke of York,
With whom he is chiefen, thou wilt shame to lord.

When I am young: O, the loss of thee,
That is not the worst, by thee being king,
That thou resign'd by him hence:
These arms he spake unto,
His oath enrolled in the prenzie's wax,
Shall, for a set of beads,

These gods, these lords, these gentlemen,
All these make thee rich, are all:
For, ere thou go, see, by Him ne'er so mean,
We three are sworn true subjects.

WARWICK:
If, by Him that raised this spirit,
Came he to my tent, how doth he fight?

KING HENRY VI:
Away! let's see: these are aRaomeo's tomb,
That hangs without our bosom.

CATESBY:
My lord!

WARWICK:
Give me your clothes: I will go call upon you.
And I will tell black brows: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he must not come;
Yea, say, I will not till my son come; he must not grieve.

KING HENRY VI:
What says he not already? he will not stumble,
Unless, by the way, I can make my way,
Both thanks and use.

YORK:
'Tis too mighty, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Ere about this kingly lion, that did never kings
So proud, by you cruel meld,

And 'tis revenge'd tolabour'd,
Not mutinous, ambitious, yielded to liberty.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Thy brother slain, he is alive.

CLIFFORD:
The higher powers forbid!

YORK:
Then fly. Lords, I say, hear me speak. Ah, poor boy!

CLIFFORD:
O, I have heard too much.

KING HENRY VI:
O bitter consequence!
If I might reach him,
Methinks I was desperate to yield him.

YORK:
'Twas very faintly borne.

CLIFFORD:
Then was he sent to by my jealousies
To his highness' prayers:
O, it is more than so, my lord:
Or whether his noble promise,
As favour whereof, stands by:
I cannot do it; and, if 'twere known,
But he is always loved my brother.

KING HENRY VI:
O, would he were dead!

CLIFFORD:
Being pent from liberty, as 'twere a shame,
Be blamed, too proud, and so break off,
To weed my vice and come in thought.

YORK:
I would he were dead!

GREMIO:
I would the shame be thus!

YORK:
For what miscarries true under his hand
Shall know, and what isested
By the false faith of him?

RICHARD:
That is, sir.

YORK:
Why whisper you, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Withal, I heard him say, and vauntingly
' cry against you.

YORK:
And you said you did mistake.

KING HENRY VI:
And you said, o'er the point of death,
When you had said that idle weeds are fast
Wherein you heard of my son's death,
And that you vaunt'd him in France.

WARWICK:
Where did I leave?

KING HENRY VI:
At that sad stop he was coming from the world,
To help Richard and cut no more of it.

YORK:
Where triumph the heavens, my lords! Our substitutes
To make theends of us, by the veil'd means
So hated, so banish'd!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Once more, triumph day, ere the day.

EDWARD:
SweetFather, revenge me to the English crown.

MONTAGUE:
How will the king revenge, with being here,
When he bade me beified in the streets?

But when we hear your fearful date in the sun
Of Phoebus' burning kisses:

When you gave us our tribuneship to endure,
Imagine I had said farewell.

Yet you gave us leave. Marcius would not spare to gird us
For what our general was to say.

We will show our general hatred,
And make his will of love.

MENENIUS:
March on, speak on:
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
To be by jointure to your remembr
Till we have had time.

BRUTUS:
Tullus Marcius would his glwere
To comb us all.

MENENIUS:
The thought of this came not home
From us determined he should win our purpose
By fearing him.

BRUTUS:
Has he thought to kill a friend of mine?

MENENIUS:
The thought of that did not satisfy his heart
For what he did.

SICINIUS:
One poor grain or two!
I am yet; the moon looks
That I am.

MENENIUS:
We'll make our stand, and he shall thank us all;
That you shall still be doing, speak to them.

BRUTUS:
O so, I pray,
Even as the flesh is not the blood
Of our great brother.

MENENIUS:
I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find
This rumour'd whose far- knowledge
Our greatest is, that we may
and will show
This true which they so seem to fear.

BRUTUS:
We must be told when we were brought you home.

MENENIUS:
The thought of this deed,--

BRUTUS:
That, were not dismay'd, why,
The resolute, bloody, and bloody deed,
Could all but distinguish the happy man
Between his child, his child,
and thine.

MENENIUS:
One poor grain or two! one three-morrow
Hath.

SICINIUS:
I cannot myself:
Pray you, let's to the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Do not mock me; I will show
What I have been, how I perform'd,
In the smiles ofCheated smiles,
Dabodements all of body,
Could never but with the most savage stamp
Upon the very
Of this present consorted.

BRUTUS:
We, the tribunes' mouths,
Edvious impudent,

TYBALT:
All this is true.

ROMEO:
Then all too late comes too late:
I have tumbled past the throw;
Here's no excuse. What ha!

TYBALT:
You hear that I have been there?

ROMEO:
Accursed, wretched, and despairing'st!
What love, what love! multitudes,
Can strew, and tender duty!
Doth love afford grace?

ROMEO:
Thy dear love have I in being a wife?

CAPULET:
Plantasticoes my eyes with in their cheeks,
And yet their beauty is made for number of.

TYBALT:
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd's note since we have left
Without a brood of rheum, none more
But only
Lie hid, as the mercer.

ROMEO:
Nine changes of the the the face
For worm broke, and two or two friends dead:
I was the chief that raised the crown,
And thouosest to depose.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know no further than this world,
How he lands and unfinish'd,
Like to the stocks. Thou know'st
Thy old right dear Redoubt is not the sore'st
Of mortal woe and woe.

LORD BERKELEY:
The base is right; and therefore, I pray thee,
If thou wilt thou kneel, as doth the chair
In chair so nigh. Come, take note of it:
For I ne'er heard yet
That any of us had cause to dispatch
This afternoon, for some of you shall be hear,
Till we heard lectures and holy thoughts,
Which we had rather tell the tale pronounced.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, the mind of that ill deed
Which told me it was done, nay, to stay,
And what it was, that it was to me
'Tis to be murder'd by his enemies.

BUSHY:
Think you, my lord, what happy deed he is
By this discovery.

ROMEO:
The bruit
To come at shrift, and my means
To come at shrift shall be his vice's bawd;
And in the sworn twelve
Shall bear the burthen of his pilgrimage,
And be his vice's end.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, uncle, what else?

DUKE OF YORK:
That in the remembrance of so fair aeed
Should be as rashly coloured:
Meantime, I do believe, and will look on
His sometimes royal, when he heard the banishment
Of Bushy, and the Earl of Wiltshire.

LORD BERKELEY:
O, I can bear
As heavy as my weighted with my thanks!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I bear no shame, my lord,--
Since you so sore woe o' the weighty Caucasus
With testimony of a feast;
But yet, if your title to the Caucasus be
Accountful, as the south to the north,
Imagine I have been there all two hours together,
And I would by and know by what hour
To call upon you our brother.

LEONTES:
Right,
We must lay down and will do't, or this treason.

Lord Marshal:
The lie, the love-breaker,
The duty-breaker and the man you bear,
Your duty tenderly given to another benefice.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
Pardon me, while I show the light.

DUKE OF YORK:
It is your high presence that exhales this deep disgrace!
How must your highness be toESS
The history of our brother's son?

DUKE OF YORK:
If that I could, 'twere needful.

DUKE OF YORK:
But I am open to what can your grace tell me:
I would he were all the proud that I could make
When I did need did need did need:
But power, my lord, scarce lets my sweet soul
Against the worst.

DUKE OF YORK:
Come, bring me to my soul.
Discharge my soldiers, and make me strong.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

Be patient. Hear me, good father.

LUCENTIO:
Ah, simple Isabella,
Why art thou in this so muddy, raw and remorseless?
Heaven let your great father live!

FLORIZEL:
He has no cause to grieve him.

LEONTES:
No, good, his cause is not right:
He should be doing, I would not be giving.

FLORIZEL:
Let him choose an officer.

AUTOLYCUS:
If he do me right, I ought not to be too forward.

LEONTES:
Why, such isle, and in such business.

POLIXENES:
Not the thing
 which I am, mistress o' the feast: you may ride's
With one crutch and a small thing; you may
But I am not China.

PERDITA:
Where were you born, friend?

FLORIZEL:
Here in Vienna, sir.

LEONTES:
You are welcome.

First Senator:
And would you were a more noble youth
As this Antium does,
Being pent from liberty, by your fair entreaty,
As I thought you did, I would not use to
Like toys to fortune and to be avoided, but to
That come too late in the wish deserves
To be your hearing dependant.

LEONTES:
That's not himself, but with some more gage
approbation.

FLORIZEL:
More of him anon.

LEONTES:
More of his anon.

FLORIZEL:
By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd ability, he had himself
The lands and waters 'twixt you and his
That would be so too!

LEONTES:
Be ruled by him.

POLIXENES:
For that, I pray, give,
Is an rascal living, that desires
A moat to be second-favour'd:
Being hated, he will not spare to gird the gods
With which he's as trifles.

LEONTES:
Be hated, but live, and I'll
Take the present benefit and leave his shame:
If something thou wouldst have him, or what is worse,
We'll give you sleepy drinks, easy-melishing.

POLIXENES:
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert
The ordering of a sisterhood?

LEONTES:
You'll mar it if you would.

POLIXENES:
Marry, that 't: one thing more, one word,
thy nurse, or another, makes thee happy:
By 'scape:
If girl's ears have not a son,
than his body's parting with his soul,
An honourable lady's living fire,
Then why should he choose
Camillo?

PAULINA:
Who would be?

EMILIA:
By your tribunes,
If he should be your judge, I should leave you;
For I will play, and see
Your honour.

LEONTES:
Wherefore, he does not approve me;
He does it; and, if he bear the matter,
Then say 'This mercy we have show'd;'
And, if the oracle,
Or pity, we must.'

PAULINA:
That 'banished' means not to say
The noble tribunes we can do't;
The people will not be contented with
burrows; the commons will not be content
With what's past, nought but so
As hangings can change their lusts
Till they have heard
Of a gross and foolish disposition,
And therefore frame
To say this boy were like us
And not the father, the king.

LEONTES:
That fellow's the face
Which I the boy, with his bonny eye,
Nay, as you mark'd him,--
Nay, spare us not.

PAULINA:
I'll show him my shame,
As I will.

EMILIA:
How now, noble queen!
What hare, that you thus have demean'd?

PAULINA:
The hate I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll pity you,--pardon me!--
I will not pity thee,--
Darest thou believe me so? Be ruled

 of openly under choice.
We'll to Ireland, to so once more joy
Than at parting parting parting parting parting parting. Now, for Lancaster
Lies thither all these friends that thought
To hand the war was created them.

Lieutenant:
Why, there is not many miles upon this molehill
To grace the court with a looking-glass.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Methinks I lost a thing
That I desire to live upon my shame:
And what necessity will I make
To help me withal?

Lieutenant:
Things cannot be avoided but by my power.

Lieutenant:
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they were heavier,
They would not thread the coats of their power.

Killing our enemies, I lost a brace of them;
And what these sorrows, these sorrows,
Shall say no more.

GREEN:
I'll never more remember what I was said
For being more pitiful of a troop
To royal purpose and ambitious in your commonwealth,
When I said, brave Earl of Richmond,
The protector lost my part,
And all my utterance.

WARWICK:
Sweet Duke of York, I remember,
To rouse thee Richard by my mind,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
When he could see his virtue now in virtue.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
That as his thought presumes he had
That honourable which he did think,
That humble revenge of this feast of York
Betroth'd my soldiers', my gentle Warwick,
Who by his soul I insinuate;
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath.

WARWICK:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen in discourse,
For it was, were not the hour that,
I'll Capitol I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
With breath, my want of strength, my want of strength.

KING EDWARD IV:
But of your cares and your cares not mine?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
No, 'tis by such care as yours
To un parenthes that are not ours.

KING EDWARD IV:
Look, if my right or wrong be,
Mine heart is not whipt out of my hand,
Because, but to mine own disgrace,
Mine honourable subject still some gossips in estimation,
Mine eye excels with dead men are asleep,
My heart is not whipt out of my body;
And, if duty tender ladies have the leading of my way,
'Tis by the consent of all that I
Shall out of dust and rubbish'd; and at that place
Where no man is contented; and, if duty tender ladies
Do not believe me, no duty, shall show so worthy
To the dead bodies of these uncles.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Alas, the base is right;
And the base lion cannot be commanded.

KING EDWARD IV:
Be it so; his head is the base knave:
And where the base is, where kings grow base,
From base-born line of endless night,
To lift up the top of majesty,
From this world-boding earth.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
By all the hopes that I have,
To love the idle pleasures that I have,
I will devise some mean precedent,
And come to them to an unstain'd grave.

GEORGE:
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When the leaves fall, the sweetest sun
Find shapes of men and gives the next degree;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely treble'd, unprovided,
And in the sudden reinforcement of a weary curse.
O Margaret, then was my father wrong'd!
Methinks his unkindness, being by,
His sudden instal'd, methinks, was an act of parliament;
For which Henry Fifth had to put the queen down,
His oath of parliament being woful musty.

WARWICK:
He which did make you fearful should have
Your right and that you this trespass of?
If you can bring to them where you were tied,
Would they were ours.

GEORGE:
I would I were, to be revenged on the matter:
To save the queen, I would say.

KING EDWARD IV:
See, our queen: yet had she title in your brother's house
======================================== SAMPLE 58 ========================================
TER:
Thou art perfect then, our queen, and I am
Your queen: yet I was not your queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Be not me; I was a queen.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, such a queen as this is, by your leave:
To speak so fairly things you were queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Look, what your majesty holds close,
And is it not hard and so boisterous
As Henry the Sixth hath to quench?

KING HENRY VI:
More than I was born, I was sworn
To never be your queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, you have, and by that sword,
She will not be your queen.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, therefore use no title to me:
I'll take my leave of you, and be gone
To keep them back that come to succor thee:
Your duty is as boundless as to this kingly king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And to that end I'll assure my daughter of
Her widowlike service.

KING HENRY VI:
O, then,
Say, Henry the Fourth by conquest got
My crown, Henry the Fifth, by conquest got
His right and mine!
We will not revenge; for this is not lend'd
To Henry's widow sister, by Edward's gift.
As Henry's means to come, I'll
In person to Henry's enemies,
And never will I lend ear to your royal grace.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why then mine title? and now 'tis mine.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me; let me know my duty,
Since duty may make me to be thy queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Me, but wrong Henry, when thou art king,
When I was crown'd I was cruel Henry.
When you were king, and how are thy children?

KING HENRY VI:
Taste of it, for thou art not brother
To any un grafted issue of common blood.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, fair queen! But of thy fault more unpardonable?

Killing our enemies, I would not be the grave
Of that deadly deed.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy fault our law calls death; but we do not say
To murder thee dead.

KING HENRY VI:
Wrath makes thee worthy, and wrong'stis too much.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Away! let's pity see thy death in these lies
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

KING HENRY VI:
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
From when this stream through muddy passages
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
Why this deadly blot:
The blood I drop is my sorrow's worst,
And in my sorrow's the worst.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me, forget of fear;
Let come more and help me still.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, gentle Clarence, that I know thou mean
To make me happy: I do remember an apothecary,
Whom I have banish'd; and, after unwork'd,
Thy overflow of reason. What, had I in my soul
To smooth the Duke of Clarence by the equal
Of Clarence' slanderous sight?
Yet, as my soul
Did plot that smooth discourse,
'Tis death to kill your king.

GLOUCESTER:
No, good devil,--

LADY ANNE:
How dares my noble heir
Come hither? by my sceptre?

On who is England's king?

GLOUCESTER:
Four of him?

GLOUCESTER:
We cannot tell: the ministers of York,
His majesty by your grace and my goodness.

QUEEN MARGARET:
He is a traitor to proud Bolingbroke.

GLOUCESTER:
And I, with a right reverend and loving child,
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, noble Clarence; and thanks unto you all:
But to the last, in the fall of so deep a parlous heap,

======================================== SAMPLE 59 ========================================
rant out of town cares not the right:
We'll arm ourselves to his friendly peace,
And make him of our own wars with despised tears;
If not to fight with enemies,
But to beat down these rebels with our own.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is about to be? is it not revenge sufficient
To make William Duke of York dead?
Conditionally, that I may dig first
Solve his doubts. But I digg'd this fortress built
From the corruption of his majesty.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
That threatened me with death;
 threatened me with death:
His haste in haste, his countenance,
When scarce spake, or whether his day of joy
Have singled the sands and rocks.
Yet I, to make all this shameless callet know herself
To's hate the offenders: I had rather
Avoid his hate by way than follow him;
For I had him entire headlongs more pride
Than one that this paper. His nature, prayge
He cannot be bruising to his soul,
But I have deserved a hate,
First of all theixed, Marcius.
O, he is kind, and, of heart,
That flatter'd him. Even thou,
Like to Clomenes, thou go'st not
To Berkeley, but to the Earl of Wiltshire:
Where, as he is a man, mighty Marcius;
And power, unto itself most royal,
Among the proudest of the proudest
Which can befall'n upon. First, here in London,
To see the Duke of Clarence dead;
And then Compare
What one of my poor house do him hate
And I can never for right acknowledge him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, you have all come to him;
Yet had not we determined he should win our hate,
He might have been content to break our country's laws.

ISABELLA:
So have we all been born to hate,
Yet with full as many friends as enemies.

DUKE OF YORK:
Three of us fought together, but one three of you;
And ten thousand of you are being those of us.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Ten thousand of us happy hours, how can you bear the day?

MONTAGUE:
I would thou hadst my woes son, how 'twere.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My woes both these happy days were fought
With words of sooth.

DUKE OF YORK:
Why, how now, my woes tell you!
I have all the leading of my care:
But for the faults of the two, when I heard
What I could befall'n upon thee,
Thy broken faith, dear; and, to this end,
I gave thee this: when he rose again,
And 'twas late, he retreat'd:
Trust me not.

ROMEO:
Why, 'twas pity. This mature dignity of kings,
But of the top, of kings, and poor lowly slaves,
Dare no more of me yet:
I am in the business out-gentleman,
And most accustom'd by my action:
Forget to pity him.

BUSHY:
What fit is this gentleman?

POMPEY:
He cannot, sir, change out of me;
The ape is dead, and I am banished.

BUSHY:
Why, 'scape! dust and shame!
I'll open of your foul descant,
And show myself a tyrant: I am I judge of your
power. Yet, to what purpose dost thou make
Mine eyes to calumny?

POMPEY:
For my part, you kiss the earth;
My sighs and they make the earth proud with kissing it.
King, I come; the earth must not be soil'd
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And thou and these thy sons, allayed like graves,
To unloose the dust and with the stones;
And thou my sons, with rezening the dust;
And thou my lovely children, Rivers
Who lack from life must complain,
Have done it, and have with wilful eye-
Doth kiss the earth as clear
As any corded life can yet stand and close.
Think not the king did this,
But thou the king.

GLOUCESTER:
The manner of his course, each asunder,
And spend our strength with over-quam self
As deep as a ever oak.

Lord:

If, by the loving charge thy father,
Of this most grievous guilty murder'd,

KING RICHARD II:
Lord marshal,--

Lord Marshal:
The Duke of Norfolk, in special charge,
Hath made a lane to-day,
Where George broke his staff.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, that a king under penalty had
His brotherhood full of quiet broils!

KING RICHARD II:
O, that a queen's kindred could ope the
Of golden sovereignty!
O, that she were as true as it!

JOHN OF GAUNT:
She shall be a maw or she'll be a queen,
If she had not a spirit to fight.

KING RICHARD II:
O, let her speak! Ah, timorous cousin!
If she had been a woman
cardinally given, I credit thee not;
For, as she is a woman of such descent,
She was just as we all.

KING RICHARD II:
She shall be a good enough married to my will,
To be so bated in your brother's veins,
As where my sons were then.
Thou, now a king, by the disguised,
To kings that were not gentlemen,
Shalt bestow my daughters' bosoms, on their hoped-for graves!

QUEEN MARGARET:
To joy, sorrow tell mother,
Of this world's desire.

KING RICHARD II:
To see sweet work perform'd, I here present
The wish of one another, to make one
Of us too young.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What fit is this our son, that we at odds
Set him up to liking for the poor thing he desires,
To come at too soon.

KING RICHARD II:
Huntsman, what say'st thou to this?

Huntsman:
O noble duke, I have caught extreme all
In jest, and I fear the wolf will sooner find
than the poor thing is ripe by fortune.

KING RICHARD II:
To take all vantages, myself will hunt
To be revenged, revenged, and myself will be
Willual by weight
My body's parting with her will.

Huntsman:
And let my soul, happy as is the day
Whiles it was done, be thus rashly.

Lord:
Upyed many years, I should have been there.

KING RICHARD II:
Then have I known too why, 'tis good:
'Tis he that sent you hither now to complain of me;
I do not know how he was cozened with regard
For what I can bear to be bear with him.

Huntsman:
Tush, man! I thank you not; for I will follow you.

KING RICHARD II:
Be patient, I will be still. I will follow you.
What shouts are these? Aves doth quoth he; even heralds
To noble acceptance of what is else
But from the sly conveyor.

CATESBY:
Could you not speak?


KING RICHARD II:
Theals in thy mind.

CATESBY:
Thy voice is thunder, and notes with a fretting tale.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
Mount you!

CATESBY:
My lord!

KING RICHARD II:
Who means our son?

CATESBY:
They do but meanly.

KING RICHARD II:
Say, Somerville.
Thou, then my name, I, Daedalus;
Thou and poor Clarence, and thou.

thou, poor Clarence! then my name!

CLARENCE:
Thou art my name's George.

GLOUCESTER:
By the George, I credit thee not;
For thou, created to be awed by the wind,
When I did look on the gentle King.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
Dly 'twixt heaven and earth.

GLOUCESTER:
The Duke of York says no more;
His oath is as true as being took bond,
As being tyrannous to you are of such weight:
Look, you, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong, and
======================================== SAMPLE 61 ========================================
 new man I can tell you:
The sullen sorrow's mortal sting of tooth
Shall I live on to look on.

ROMEO:
Give me leave to live.

FRIAR LAURENCE:

ROMEO:
Commend me to.

JULIET:
Ay, spare to be.
Anon! what mercy bades me,
To save the innocent: yet go on me!
I pray thee, take get you in; for they are
to common.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love,
The tender lady whom I am, have been my father
Evermore proud, I have been thus much:
O, she is grown most kind of late,
Such late as is her sire,
And therefore, her alone are not fourteen.
I must be tarry till my son come; he halls,
The one grey, the other king;
For I am pale at water,
That I do see: I dare think
Why, then the king's image is not so.
O, you are so pale!

JULIET:
O, I do not know what I can tell thee?

Nurse:
O lady Fortune, I remember it to the king;
And now will I let thee tell the rest.

ROMEO:
Fie, you confine not how I shade him:
So that I, being but one, and one for one,
To what foul redemption of this feast
Earthly, of these black and obscene fiends
That I, being but one, here standers looking on,
To what I am, necessity and myself.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Nay, rather, no more!
Come, son, go with me; we'll not down.

ROMEO:
Fie, you confine not to me: I will come,
In troth, I would not come down to-day.

JULIET:
What's o'clock?

ROMEO:
Upon the stroke of ten.

JULIET:
Well, let it strike.

ROMEO:
Why, 'tis yours.

JULIET:
Give me leave to go.

ROMEO:
Not so: farewell. What's o'clock?

Nurse:
JULIET:
To-morrow; to-day; presently.

JULIET:
What is the matter, my lord?

ROMEO:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.

Nurse:
Let me know by whom.

JULIET:

Well, you have not been inquired after:
I am sat and I fear you not.

ROMEO:
I will follow thee one word,
and therefore be gone.

JULIET:
Is it good, think you?

ROMEO:
Utto me, thus wrong'st, and false.

Nurse:
Is it good den? Let me know who.

JULIET:
A little office may confound with the lady:
I am a kind of lady, and I thank the gods
For that which thou profane'st,
For she was Ajax, call'd so far
That birds would sing and I could reach them.

Nurse:
I'll bear theea, my lord, in thanks:
God send me many years of sweet sorrow!
O, sweet nurse, I have ever to send
A merriment of her proportions
Loved!

ROMEO:
Nine years, the most peerless piece of e' the gods,
She was my wife, till my infant come;
I, with I spake her, but with mighty tears,
She bow'd her gentle denial,
Am I then Gremio; then young Gremio,
And wrathful sympathy must be seen,
How I am gremified, that she, poor Margaret,
Unto these forced years,
Fear'd my present profession, and in this life
Lie hid moe thousand times,
When I have longest been separated in arms.

ROMEO:
Fie upon her! what storm is this of hers?
O, love York, how doth my dear morsel
Comeet at my thankfulness? But how out of this sudden babes
Hath she the benefit that I might?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Young MARCIUS, it is excellent now:
Anon, I can tell you;
The decreed prince, that whom late I had first unro
======================================== SAMPLE 62 ========================================
 upon thee;
What dost thou make here in this delay?
Shall we go throw away our miles and sigh
To the ground? Come, good cousin, let's home.

DUKE OF YORK:
No, by my soul, I will not go:
Come, good cousin, help to deck our mates
Where where may I should be slaughter'd.

KING RICHARD II:
Ghost of Prince Edward:

YORK:
When I parted hence, saw you were like to glaze
Yourself my soldiers', up and down,
On you no more must stay to retire:
When you were at Exeter, and Titus Lartius,
The drops of blood were all themselves there,
That we might digest our complarts.
Would some among you would fly to France,
And some of you?

MENENIUS:
Go, get, go, get home, be trusty, and I'll
Leave this young man in pawn till I bring him.

CORIOLANUS:

YORK:
Give me my boots: I have set them on.

MENENIUS:
When I were last in Holborn, I saw
him: he frown'd, I saw him;
But then Aufidius found me;
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity.

MENENIUS:
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.

'Tis he foul in no one of you.

BRUTUS:
He is drunk, my lord, and I know by where.

And the Marvellous gods,

 requites such purple friends to be
Even in the bosom of the people,
Are as his proud, with honourable action,
As is the theme of himself,
And many more his friends sworn to't.

MENENIUS:
Take honour! 'tis Marcius;
Who here shall bear him, whose son
is appointed Duke of Exeter.

BRUTUS:
From whence?

YORK:
From Rome.

MENENIUS:
Why, thereon!

BRUTUS:
Return, Marcius!
Let us presume with idle spiders to our dug
Where heavy-gaited gnats will not tread
The graves of Rome.

Farewell, make us safe.

First Senator:
Farewell.

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
I hope they'll hold to me.

MENENIUS:
This patrician justice puts us in mind
Of what we hope to prevent.

BRUTUS:
Hail! I am thus bold to put your power,
Which you do accuse is deceiveable and false
To prick at others. All will be his help,
And help you with plot, come down:

Even thou and all, as thou art perfect,
Shall bear the stamp of chivalry,
And make thy soldier, by-morrow

BRUTUS:

You are brave, man;
You are darken'd, your eyes abroad are blacker
Than in your chair full three-score:
O, bear me in the arms
Of this most noble favour!

KING RICHARD II:
O, good a deed! and most guilty!

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, if I were thy chief,
Thy honour had been more true than mine.

KING RICHARD II:
Nor night's cloak to hide me from this kingly title,
Embarquements all proofs sleeping else

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, let me know thy mind!

KING RICHARD II:
Methinks I should be a prophet new inspired
And learn to know that which I think.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Men bear the shame, butcher, in my deadly hate,
The proud insulting man thou art,--man, thou o'erly
Show'd thy dear heart, like an engine,
An humble suit to bound and restrain
From the dead bodies of slaves to be their fall down.

THOMAS:
The thought of this purblind soul--

LORD FITZWATER:
That thought did never fence the right,
When Dastar had fell out with the body of the womb.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Brave Plantagenet, yonder comes true:
I think thou hadst not steel'd him to the death,
But you more must use it in the delaying death.

CLIFFORD:
Some strong armlock must help to help him stay,
Till you may arm yourself to help him stay:
But need it, and let it not be doubted
To seek us to the empty, vast and wandering air.

Messenger:
My lord, the Duke of Norfolk is slain in rescuing me;
And your chief followers to the town of Leicester
In every mean to follow us.

CLIFFORD:
Twenty-three miles off the duke is with the soldiers slain?

Messenger:
Where George of Clarence is become, and every man's
Like to the white-upturned shore.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
More of this than that, or more, within this hour,
If from this palace of sunshine days be not yet known,
My lords and sovereign are both are well:
But, if they be that wise Duke of York,
Let it command a mirror
To prove him me; and therefore let me,
With all the friends that thou bear,
To straight shall be thy winding-sheet,
On thy shoulder shall I rest awhile.

KING RICHARD II:
No longer stay;
Am I king for this Plantagenet.

CLIFFORD:
Short marches andwenty rages and fair triumph day.

SOMERSET:
My lords,--

KING RICHARD II:
Sweet-hearted cousin, at my feet
I heard the fearful noise of our parting;
Such as with a broken delivery shall clear
What words are writ, that are to me no word:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;
That very bootless is the death of kings.

SOMERSET:
I will be brief when I am gone.

KING RICHARD II:
To-morrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, there thou hast need of more hours
To-morrow than a necessary day.

OXFORD:
Look, any thing that we ordained festival,
Commit me to the grave of God,
And perform a saint-like mercy;
And after that I am gone unto Venice.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
Where I will be sworn to his trial,
To take it not trouble me not;
But let it come too late,
To confirm my love or bounty.

KING RICHARD II:

But, if he be strong and, I'll give him assurance
When I have betched him. To-morrow hold divided
Bettering, wretched, changing, and

CAMILLO:
He wears my lord's garland; and, on my frights and griefs,

Some three-pile; some one with child,

As shall revenge his death before I stir.

Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.

KING HENRY VI:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces.

WARWICK:
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.

KING HENRY VI:
The lord protector lost it, and not I:
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.

No, when some certain word there was throw'd down.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why, that was when I parted hence,
Marry, and not with this talk.

Leave me, sit on me: I will look upon you.

BUCKINGHAM:

And how, after his wearing, Marcius,
Did set the nobility of Rome.

PETRUCHIO:
For what can he say?
'I would I would I would I were returned,
The better for me:.'

BUCKINGHAM:
Then what he said is that did not repent me;
He call'd me brother; and what he said,

And you should ofomplock.

What is to you here?

BRUTUS:
If, Tullus,
Thy words come short.

How now, noble ladies!

Lord:
He hath got his mortal hurt worthily of his coming forth,
His oath enrolled in his physician's veins,
But not the punishment of the threatening him.

COMINIUS:
Where's that ill deed?
Where is he wounded?

MENENIUS:
To Marcius:
I'll know that when he comes.

COMINIUS:
The people will remain uncertain whilst he's found:
The tribunes are soldiers and patricians, and there
Your power i' the senate, and you
In all kind o' the action.

MENENIUS:
The senate
To Rome are we sworn subjects: Marcius is worthy
To cease the wars, and give Rome
A noble memory: Come, we'll
From Rome we will walk; and go
The people will be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With Tarpeian envy.

MENENIUS:
 Tarpeian, to whom we were sworn,
He was my friend:
Now Tarpeian shall shine by-day
Tullus Marcius shine; and you
That struck him back in the city.

BRUTUS:
It is thus: Marcius is no more
That makes the rabble: mark his deeds,
Be follow'd:
If you report him more, we'll keep Rome
Our men and our small.

MENENIUS:
Now, Tarpeian,--

BRUTUS:
Come, go, where you can!
He is your butt.

MENENIUS:
Being moved, what is this?

BRUTUS:
Be calm,
For we have landed in ill cause.

MENENIUS:
If I could by Himford meaner,
This Marcius to come had a consul,
Whose duty of great momentary justice
The noble tribunes had,
His own honours even of merit,
No doubt his virtue would move laughter
To yield what he can make you pleased.

BRUTUS:
Pray now,
Go home, home, be home, and get thy home;
If you will not home, I'll leave you:
Let's to the Capitol;
To-morrow, tell me,
Who is to-morrow:
Look, sir, their faces
And be the eyes of the ignorant moon.
I cannot tell what's given freely.
I am not the day's chief.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled by me, forget, be wary,
Be ruled by me.

First Senator:
Clarence, be certain to his oath.

MENENIUS:
If, by the jealous queen of heaven,
Or that divine mother which is here,
Thy wife and children of men, as I learn,
Thy men were all, as I thought,
I could make bold with a looking-glass;
But in the base court?

BRUTUS:
Ra!

MENENIUS:
It does not.

BRUTUS:
Let me know't.

MENENIUS:

To greet them when after supper.

COMINIUS:
If they do me right, I'll do them right.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not be so bold with
Their choice: but I'll show them all
In our design.

BRUTUS:
Let them rest. Come, you confute not these designs
To way.

SICINIUS:
To them!

BRUTUS:
You look as if you held an oath
That you had quietly reign'd more
Than what you have done.

MENENIUS:
No;
For, by my soul, I see,
I do not this while:
These wars determine of us to come,
Our substitutes at home shall go
And we return back our power when being found.

BRUTUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by myself, by myself alone.

MENENIUS:
We make their mouths alike, present, to our bodies'
And strew'd your hearts with deafening.

To haste thus fast, but not lend his blood
To banish'd slaves brought to fortune's cross-work'd.

As miserable of day, it is:
Even thou and these sad designs, designs and jump in joy,
Shall rue this hour, for if joy can admit society,
Tell o'er me three or four miles
I would wish them death.

OXFORD:
'Tis death's worst, death's worst, and that end.

SOMERSET:
Art thou sure of this?

KING EDWARD IV:
Marry, I would he were twenty.

OXFORD:
Thy son is not the worst, for thou
Shalt by the father owning it;
For inequality and bidding, where thou mayst,
Sily one subject.

MENENIUS:
If I had thought thee o'er this country's hapt,
'Tis in thy good will.

OXFORD:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of me.

SOMERSET:
O, be ruled: I'll come to leave my son:
Let him and my son come; for either of you
Must come to his account, by your own instruction,
And whatsoever thing your will employ us.

KING EDWARD IV:
Alas, poor Clarence! is he in our behalf?

SOMERSET:
He, my lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who, my lord?

KING EDWARD IV:
Thomas of Earl of Warwick, by my good leave?

QUEEN MARGARET:
The Duke of Clarence, by your leave, by your leave.

KING EDWARD IV:
What else? a title! and a lusty title?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, but thou shouldst be taught by me.

KING EDWARD IV:
But I am in this not too dangerous:
Bear your body in the warmest mind,
And warm thee, Clarence! 'tis the best.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, with mykin's black veil?

CLARENCE:
My body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And my mind is changed:
Since thou never came from us, I leave it,

WARWICK:
What, with my gage, you would not spare us:
 our brother Montague shall be withained.

KING EDWARD IV:
Give me some aqua vitae! some black colour.

GLOUCESTER:
I had rather be a country servant than a loving queen.

PRINCE:

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, so, my goodly brother, I thank you all:
I will some sorrow gaze me some more

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so, therefore, I pray, are not the worst.

KING EDWARD IV:
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Then, executioner hands off.

GLOUCESTER:
When supposed, I put your power out.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To tell, I would wereagest.

GLOUCESTER:

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, then,--

GLOUCESTER:

QUEEN MARGARET:

To have the crown once more.

WARWICK:

GLOUCESTER:
To have him kill a wife.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, then have I done some villanous shame:
For which I am I then, saw thou speak'd;
And follow'd, that I pity thee.

GLOUCESTER:
O, kill me poor Clarence, by Edward's means:
But when I did take pity of him,
'Tis not revenge sufficient for me to kill.

Bearing such bitter threatening looks.

Her virtue would not have seen't.

Thou wouldst be content:
He shall not proud me;
We'll be no stoics nor no stocks:
I'll take no money,ea,ea.

No money, I pray:
For some strong purpose.

In those foundations which you build upon,

To be thus nought, or to be too heavy,

Look, sir, I do not know what:
You must contrary me! say you were afraid;
If you might please to come to you, and
At what hour to-morrow you shall

If honourable, and needful preparation,
That honourable day,
Why camest thou hither, by this fair moon,
To greet me with this wish of adversaries?
O, but they say we two did meet
In my heart-blood;
That did the sender of the devil:
I cannot but with speed attempt it out;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys
In every respect where I expect my life.
The odds both are good for me;
And yet the odds both shrinkthens, give me leave:

To make his tale large.

WARWICK:
Henry now is Duke of York.

EDWARD:
But Henry now break'd the title of England.

WARWICK:
Enforced him, and dangers the king.

YORK:
'twas never pity Henry should cut his glory down.

KING HENRY VI:
Be patient, Duke of Clarence.

YORK:
For what miscarries Henry's death,
When he did look for England's enemies,
He was stabb'd by bloody Duke of York.

RICHARD:
That I do wonder; how these lands,
That are by them and these thy sons,
And how are we finger'd together,
That in the concupiscible blood
Like trees bedash'd with rain,
That seem'd to send their waters even to one place,
I cannot do it; and yet I know,
that this most grievous murder done me.

WARWICK:
Mine honour is my life.

Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.

Why, how now! can so with bootless cry,
As with a child,--

Methinks I see your grace in person.

EXETER:
But not in person, proud Plantagenet,
To doom him hence forth of breath;
Conditionally, that here you take the leave
To see this knack, perform'd withal.

KING HENRY VI:
But I cannot tell:
Sweet York, with the years thou wast my father.

YORK:
 years we banish him, but he shall come too late:
He shall not come too late: we'll seize upon devices.

KING HENRY VI:

But therefore yield me not thy consent to-night.

YORK:
Give me leave to go.

KING HENRY VI:
Good uncle York, let me know my fault:
On what condition stands it and wherein?

YORK:
At some points in this our parliament,
Where we'll lay down and reign our Henry.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, this is All-Souls' day,
Since we have begun the bloody parliament,
Where will we be,--If we will,
If we will.

WARWICK:
What! art thou, man? thou hast some children of your highness' age
In the remembrance of those wrong'd years?

YORK:
Those are some children, my lord, that will be
I' the eyes of heavy mind
To unloose thee. O, that they were
As cheap as words!
I see, sweet uncle, by my rights,
Thy beauty in the court of France
And the beauteous virtue of my fortune!
For these great affairs do I wish,
That thou this sovereign, as thy brother,
Were king at Calais.

WARWICK:
Why, what then?

KING HENRY VI:
What then!

YORK:
I thank thee not; and, seeing 'twas
To be the best how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?

WARWICK:
That I count for this: but to conclude with truth,
Ere we were Richard's enemies,
We may have been down together, but we are
That we may have been so short a day
To cross the seas of this most grievous need.

OXFORD:
That's off, that's not so.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet uncle, to let him know me,
I think he'll wear the livery of my body.

But to conclude with him, we must entreat the Lady Northumberland
To visit the next room, which he must use
As if they show me some one take order Buckingham be

And in the commons' mind of France,
And in the seat of Coriolanus,
Their bands i' the vaward: and, for your name,
Put that, to make me know
The noble tribunes, that is never
To say for consul.

MENENIUS:
That's enough.

BRUTUS:
Come, get you home;
You must rise and be ruled:
Under and by are to rise; therefore let
The people suffer
If he remember me not.

Not having my country, I care not
To get slips of them.

MENENIUS:
You must be ruled.

Those are a cavil:
Where I should lineal, were it farther
Than misery could make: for sorrow
Shall sing and dance.

SICINIUS:
I'll bear thee my body, my soul!

BRUTUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
Away! go, bear ye my me my head.

SICINIUS:
You must desire your to visit him.

MENENIUS:

May Marcius cannot choose.

BRUTUS:
Let's fetch him off, he'll not be so;
The people will not be satisfied.

MENENIUS:
Therefore I say with you.

BRUTUS:
I will be his help in every where:
Pray you, take them to the rock Tarpeian.

MENENIUS:
O Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded
A noble memory, us cannot forget
Our greatest friends are those are those us
That we must help.

BRUTUS:
Let's step into the shadow
With great brooping hope:
A party as hard as steel,
As hasty powder, as the wind
To humbly bend our loves!

MENENIUS:
Fush, Marcius!

BRUTUS:
Nay, us must stay.

MENENIUS:
Let's step into the shadow
Withhold our friends.

BRUTUS:
A noble fellow,
If looking liking the Marcius,
As we can, we shall
Hear him byoving streets,
And from thence our fair find something
To him that eye.

MENENIUS:
What follows this?

BRUTUS:
That we may not down, but you must return
To our account.

MENENIUS:
I will subscribe your thanks and take it;
For the inheritance of my loves and safeguard
Of my loyal mistress.

COMINIUS:
Our trust, Marcius, lies
In numbers of these wars' arms.

BRUTUS:
In War, I will lay you down to your fortune:
If you take it not and blow it down,
Your honour.

MENENIUS:
I'll temper them down.
What is their seeking?

COMINIUS:
The parties of the people,
His instruments fair, and his supple nature,
By you unhascried.

MENENIUS:
'Tis but folly;
The parties of the people and his fame,
To cavil in their enmity.

SICINIUS:
Edicts it folly;
The tribunes cannot do't, and will say
To Marcius whom they soever lated.

MENENIUS:
What then?

BRUTUS:
Only their loves.

MENENIUS:
If he do me right, 'twas folly.

BRUTUS:
No;
For every part of Marcius they gave

When they were at Exeter.

Where we must show you these things
That we may.

How it was to me as to this fault?
O, pardon me, give it you know
To pardon me! Your brother is sending over masquers
To revel it with him for the pride of you
Which he so sets at nought.

LEONTES:
What, what,
Came I hither but that thought
To take a brother for the minister of mine?

PAULINA:
No, nor he's not prepared for that offence.

The king, I claim by open war,
The gods be good to us, and we will look
To
Before the army that follow us.

LEONTES:

Nor I, but to tell, good my lord,--
For that which I'll procure,
The resignation of the prince will be here,
Because what I have said is held at such
Whilst all sects and all are writ.

LEONTES:
Shall we hear from inside court?

PAULINA:
O, no!
Either eye with a sigh,
Or sigh with one that swears
Till I heard 'em told,
And these external manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swears ere I did see:
Seal thus, but come forth, and bid us doubt
Our happiness is but bond and privilege.

LEONTES:
How now, my lord! speak.

ANTIGONUS:
This is the indictment of the good queen,
Who hath a son, who is
By law and process of great nature,
And that he is who made
From man to woman: what then?

ANTIGONUS:
Dost thou believe
That I may breathe here without breath,
And that those parts of man
Do climate here in earth?

LEONTES:
Do not believe
That he bears me with love.

PAULINA:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

LEONTES:
Good queen, with such a daughter,
As 'twere the daughter of my most kind aunt,
And then the father and the general;
County Anselme, or thy mother,
Which modern times of joy
Doth make us short but,
We may blow our nails with these swelling tears;
And yet we were seen to conquer our hearts.
Tyrants are we like two men: have been ten times
In one most weary room.

LEONTES:
Alone I did it:
For which doth he centre, and cannot say
He used to scorn our solemnity?
Now, by the jealous queen of my nature,
Toldly 'twas to support
The present benefit which I dearly love.

PAULINA:
He marries us,
As I thought, and yet his honour.

Would he were dead! I hear his lamentation!

PAULINA:
Such pity as his doing.

LEONTES:
Such pity as his doing.

ANTIGONUS:
Such pity!

EMILIA:
Such dear my lord,
Should by my deserving I be perforce withheld
Into his highness. Camillo and Polixenes, whom
Have made their pastime at the table,
The interchange of their power and mine
Shall be the supreme imperial type of their encounters.
Now we have struck ourselves,
Our pastime toward the unking'd duke,

From whence we came, of whose feather was
The root of your steed's root: I giving here
A moat defensive'd bough and a toss'd one;
I giving here this, to be thus perused
With their love and safeguard.

Of a small needle'swork: there, as the rocks cheer'd me

Our poor inheritance, homely gifts,
Shall be your winding-sheet.

MENENIUS:
I'll prove him;
We'll show our general livery.

CORIOLANUS:
You make a show,
Proud, your friends!

MENENIUS:
I do not flatter.

SICINIUS:
May it please your majesty to send the people
To this most suspected, as the present,
In the people's minds:
What's he?

MENENIUS:

Third Senator:
Worthy tribunes,--

MENENIUS:
He will not flatter
The lip of the needer: need you must think
Me lasts but to-morrow.

Read our very heart:
The need we have made
Our demands to the gods andOur met rewards
Shall be your winding-sheet. Why faint you,
Since you must be full of something
Which you, your form, wisdom, and the fear
To use it on your pleasure, you must

BRUTUS:
Methinks he looks as clear
As any he could.

MENENIUS:
No, by such eye, as he gives entrance to such companions?
But does he count the precious number of your loves?

Messenger:
If, by his own report of the town
And from the mean of birth,
I may have heard him say and shall be heard
Toay to you and pray with you;
But since you do speak too coldly.

SICINIUS:
Come, come, you must go visit the mind
Of him you do not mind to-day.

MENENIUS:
Return, Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

SICINIUS:
He will no more of it.

MENENIUS:
 Trust me, I know whence his ladies are:
where he comes, they say he will, the gods look down,
and
To him so proud as he does himself.

BRUTUS:

To this supposed he is our admiring.

SICINIUS:

To prate and talk at your pleasure.

MENENIUS:
That's my bawcock.

Well, no more; I will not budge.

PARIS:
Beseech you, my lord, by your leave:
To-morrow will it please you.

Even for sedition, as you say,
And for your brother's living ghost.

LADY ANNE:
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.

Go home to bed, and see this hour executed.

PARIS:
Marry, go, and see this writing, by when
We make our story pronounced.

LADY ANNE:
Give me leave to read.

ATER:
I know it, and will find it.

PRINCE:
Accursed be he that lay those grievous crimes
To you and your poor host!

LADY ANNE:
Cursed, unhappy, wretched!

Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of unloads thee!
But that after many scorns and many debags,
Thy brother is death's black hand, which, with a vow,
Was fast belock'd in the land,
And many giddy people flock to him.

YORK:
O, now, my lord!
If I had fear'd to be afraid,
The happy deed was cruel death.
If I had fear'd to be a moat,
Thou'rt afraid to come;
If not to be afraid to obey.

GLOUCESTER:
If I had fear'd to be a king,
The happy deed was cruel death.
If I had fear'd to be a king,
The happy deed was upon you,
That it would labour my blood.

YORK:
'Tis pity.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet father, by my soul, I cannot tell:
We must be gentle, since, by God's good leave,
Our gentle father is so ill.

YORK:
O, thou tell'st, the lords are proud.

GLOUCESTER:
To be so proud is not simple,
For many men say you are myself.

YORK:
I thank you, gentle uncle.

GLOUCESTER:
But I be deceived, that you are not
The grave of your majesty.

YORK:
To-morrow will it please your majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow, then, I judge--
To be your title right or wrong:
'Tis not Clarence; where indeed,
But in the last, in every borough,
I heard the citizens say to this black- obscene man,
That he was beaten of your kind aunt,
His humour not provoked by your loves;
'Tis downright told, and not by your tongue.
O gentle uncle! what dost thou make here?

An egg of ten pounds; a most idle flower
For is a poor thing it is to count.

GLOUCESTER:

Beseech thee, beseech thee!

YORK:
Who sets me else? by heaven, I would
never be so angry.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, lay down your treasures upon them:
If you take it not another coat,
 bury mine with some more rich man's hide
Than twenty of my sweet loved.

I wonder if you'll take it you for the last,
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
Than I had seen you. Come, cousin you hither;
In what you fancy more than I,
In any thing so horrible, will I;
And come, go, you take it to you.

 rich uncle! how long is it now
To breathe such secrets
As you judge: and since you come too late
To know a noble tale
Which you have made to endure your brother's death,
When you depart from him, but I do not give
What your tale pronounced shall be to that matter.

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, cousin,--

YORK:
What'er thou hear'st, cousin? by my good lord.

GLOUCESTER:
But I have no brother's motive,
Lest he had been convey'd to devices,
When once did set down his high imperial type,
He did so set his high blood upon my head
That stain'd his very blood with blood:
As you lay fell in chains, but my name remains;
My partly by sorrow and heart's malice,
Both grow in one part.

QUEEN:
From such a cruel threatening look as this reported.

KING HENRY VI:
My gracious lord, I cannot tell:
If I had fear'd us to be about,
The happy was always to be cross in talk.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lord.
And what conceit is most pleasing to conceal it;
and better it were to show a gracious acceptance.

KING HENRY VI:
To brat and to confirm were worthy death.

QUEEN:
Condemn them to faces of head, and to confirm were law.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of my son:
I'll bear thee my body, giving him shortly
To an unstain'd daughter shortly bid me joy.

QUEEN:
Whoity with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

EDWARD:

Commend me to my unwilling daughter.

QUEEN:
Ay, with such gentle sorrow as her,
Lordable little purpose, but often am I grieved.
I sent her hither to purchase honour
The which he gave me at his hands.

KING HENRY VI:
'Tis full of your cares:
He would not do't with me, did you hear me name it.

QUEEN:
Had you affections and warm'd your hands were higher than
You look on me, I should how gone.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet son Edward, with the loving kiss of your heart,
And gentle daughter, as low as to your eyebrows,
This brotherly father York and my cousin Buckingham,
You never convey'd me to anyught but
The proceedings of the house of York shall down.
O, you are passing empty; are not safe.

QUEEN:
Come, my lord, what talk you of my love?

KING HENRY VI:
With child, my lord, he talk'd of me;
And now to London all the time was once there.
I cannot tell what safe way I was to call him.

To tell you how these lands are to be got,
You know there are two councils held;
And therefore gives I leave to go
Where it fits you to know.

YORK:
How ha! know not where;
What men are willing to this young princely Duke?

KING HENRY VI:
If I were his widow, I would esteem him worth a thousand crowns.

YORK:
He is not lightly, as I am,
If any grudge were lodged between us.

RICHARD:
What counsel give you? whither shall you gaze on his queen?

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
Are not your highness shall show me what I say?

Highestomach dissembling set on your highness' face?
If not, I'll give him glory.

KING HENRY VI:
O gracious majesty, I come, what lord you speak,
Shalt feel our justice, and know what they think.

YORK:

CLIFFORD:
If his title right, 'tis by his right:
But if he be dead, why give I this,
Because my pity, which is right,
There's no wrong, but every thing is right.

KING HENRY VI:
Whoever got thee, 'tis by my dread looks
That was your look-fellow.

YORK:

KING HENRY VI:
As I was a king,
Where on my fortune indeed you heard
The happy tidings of the two kings are deliver'd

BRUTUS:
Ay, like a good lord.

Will not be much amiss with thee,
Because I will be king, ere I sleep.

CLARENCE:

GLOUCESTER:
From Scotland.

BUSHY:
You will not own it.

GREEN:
Chare you well, Duke of Exeter?

KING RICHARD II:
If I were a king, 'twas my name,
From Scotland and from England.

BUSHY:
Why, therefore you are not unknown to this business.

GREEN:
Nine justices' hands are mine: and therefore, I pray thee,
Among these fourscore fat-foot kings encamp'd by.

KING RICHARD II:
My lord, I cannot tell how these lands
They are to be got and how these lands
 are to be got: and therefore please me
To take our brother Clarence out, and else
To effect our justice.

BUSHY:
Brother, this is your fault:
You must in person to give your own voice,
And when you speak to him, why he sends you this kind
Of brotherhood, your kind of son of worship,
And maintain you as his person were flesh.

KING RICHARD II:
Brother, this is your fault:
Why were you sworn to the king?

BUSHY:
To help King Edward in his time of blood,
When he did about him, it is not so.

KING RICHARD II:
But I have to strong and bold conspiracy
Enforced him to the extremest bleeding war.

BUSHY:
I think his majesty
 will be full of gentle words,
Even as his humour would seem to be,
Even as his humour would, were he sworn,
Against the Duke of Clarence, at his kingly height
Where he did show me he did to insult my height
The hateful bow of nature.

GREEN:
Thomas Richmond, how haught aught I say
To thee, my lord.

KING RICHARD II:
If I crown him, let me prophesy:
The blood of enemies will be thy winding-sheet;
That paper and to all occasions
Set me, lords, to dwell upon.

BUSHY:
I have been crown'd the hateful day,
When I were crown'd by the false and timew.
Tare you well, I know, and I hope to live:
My prayers to you, and my true heart's sorrow
Shall be to you, and all the pleasures of these days
Shall bear the same heaven and all that heaven these sad days

KING RICHARD II:
What, pray you, lords?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To breathe such vows as to another life.

KING RICHARD II:
So thrive I, as I truly swear perfect love!

BUSHY:
Bear me to prison, where I may
Enjoy a wife withal.

KING RICHARD II:
But were you sworn to that place, where I remain,
As certain of my soul we were, false o' the house,
Then were they chosen:
Because, by great computation of the time,
The splits of malice which never brooked
Show scarr'd upon us.

BUSHY:
Then no more of it.

KING RICHARD II:
Come, go see it.
Gentle citizens, that are the cause of me
Have committed me to your hate,
I doubt not but to yield to you off to-proud York,
Because by yours ever;
And, if you love my children, hate not me;
Why, uncle, why, your kind of brotherhood,
Flow'd with brotherhood.

BUSHY:
Flow'd you with that black bastard bastard is of fourscore pounds?

KING RICHARD II:
If I were his child, I should have my daughter's name;
But I had not name to call your brother.

BUSHY:
His name I hate, and not his name.

KING RICHARD II:
What of him? he's an adulteress;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
But by the wanton with a pedigree of spleen;
I say you have lain'd me down, and you my fair stars:
Sweet madam, put up; you must be gone.

BUSHY:
Pray God, I say, imprison me of your metal,
Where you may ride like a gnat.

In slaves of men, finds but one: he'll steal all

Nay, rather, my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas?

GREEN:
If he could burn us all into one coal,
We should not coal to burn it.

BRUTUS:
That fellow is a fellow of the house of Montague.

GREEN:
Being a bawd, he sure,--

BUSHY:
His coming is a bitter deputy.

BAGOT:
His coming is a signal that says nothing but
The twos and his sighs.

BUSHY:
I saw him but a:
And, which I dare fancy,
His looks were better than any other.

GREEN:
His looks were better than any present time,
And yet his nature never brook'd a line
But to the determination of a man:
He brain'd our design, and not the hair
Of our design, but, as one favour'd another
To prick the temper of some that sued
His oath against us.

BUSHY:
That fellow is a fellow of our intents.

GREEN:
Which God revenge!

BUSHY:
Why, thus he stands, King of Buckingham,
To set the peace of both.

GREEN:
To so, therefore, let it be so:
Pray God, help!

BUSHY:
Help, help! my wounds are drawn.


BUSHY:
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
But buckle with thee habit and envy in a deep
For nothing but it.

GREEN:
I cry mercy mercy, sir. Do not slander him.

BUSHY:
Pray you, get you home, be strong and prosperous
In this your kindred's business.

GREEN:
We must everyforce have you to go about
To-morrow?

Bushy, on Thursday: sure, some friends of this are friends
To the people.

If they have not troops, why should they have troops,
As they are chosen:
Besides, on Wednesday next we solemnly fast,
And therefore shall be kept,
Our may be to London sent over by Bushy,
To help you more than we thought of!

To visit the next room, if we remember it.

And be not hot, with our sighs, whilst they were gone.

BUSHY:
For I myself have caught extreme cold.

And I such need to help me with the like.

As sickness cannot admit society,
And in me no need such apology.

HASTINGS:
Dear God, I dare smile I cannot speak:
And as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the precedent's due of us,
And as we stand, our succession;
So that in the seat royal we sue
The man-boding lion our deceased bodies
And mark the majesty of our dear Redeemer,
Who, when they do retire,
Will maintain it to the spur;
If he do me right, we'll give him thanks,
And pray the Lady Bona quit his pain,
Who for her part cheers me above,
And I, that go on with him.
So, let her alone, or so my pity prove
To prick the cold Caucasus. Eyes, look your last!
Come, go, bind thou on my gage;
Go, and fetch a looking-glass.
Where is the looking-glass on the looking-glass?
Where are the poor beginners of my fray?

If that be sound enough, yet that I sound as sweet
As love which poets fearewell.

Shall cross to title, and break out with thee!
O, that thou mayst prove so bitter, and so tame!

From all the dress'd office of the feast:
Where 'scape is predominant; and over and over

That can count our watch, and all are

Alas, I hate thee not; for thou ne'er is my right:

When I had show'd truth which I have said,

Then wrath o'er-look'd upon me; and wrath o'er-eye

Out, alas! I wrath his worthless threats!
And, now I have my wish, revenge my death!

As is the bud bit with an envious worm
That shows no end to touch!--your honours all;
Whilst my presence, your prayers,

Your majesty, against the consent of supreme law,
Intake to your royal self this proffer'd benefit,
If he did need your loves, and that is not your shame:

This wish. Follow me, hungry son,
And honour me not; for this I dare
Put knees to my teeth. Come, let us free the shame
Of frowning. Come, cousin.

I would I had been a poor groom
By your own livery.

Nurse:

O, I am a poor groom of your hand!

ROMEO:
How are you, sir?

Nurse:
If, by your tricks, you had been
The soldiers' soldiers, you'ld had been
The soldiers', you'ld had been down,
You're hare used, and your livery?

ROMEO:
O, I am sorry that I may pass
The people's officer.

Nurse:
These times of lethargy I hate
Have cloak and my life upon my back:
These are the things I hate.

ROMEO:
These are ha' done now, I tell you.

Nurse:
O, he hath got his friends with child,
And overmuch more of them fought in their defence:
But is he slain in your highness' fault?

ROMEO:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the worst of him so I age,
Accountant to the great'st degree.

Nurse:
Accursed, pernicious, wretched!
I have about me many parcels of ill.

ROMEO:
What, is there such an air of them?

Nurse:
These are some stair-works.

ROMEO:
Pardon me, dear; let's pardon me no more:
Or, if you knew my greatness,
Thy mother, I would not spare to grieve
To have my glory true.

Nurse:
These are a side that I wish'd them.

ROMEO:
I love them.

Nurse:
These are goodly, they are.

BENVOLIO:
Two of them, by one step below, the one in your heart;
The other, by jouncing Bolingbroke,
If this rebellious earth of justice be honours,
Be ruled by your means,
And we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

BENVOLIO:
Titus Lartius, thou ladder whereof,
Keeps transgression to the highest.

MONTAGUE:
Full of worthy art.

LARTIUS:
Go bear this part, and fetch a looking-glass.

BENVOLIO:
The pleasure that some part of this anatomy shows,
Such as the cunning of self-boding,
I do I cannot, measure me; but,
Like a waking, I will not endure your presence,
Like to a pleasant sleep. To my gross selves,
Your knees to me; you will not--
Since you will not rest, but either part with me,
To lie with me in the shadow of my choice:
IWill you walk? nay, cousin, you'll not be so lean:
But you must be ruled by me. Come, cousin.
In the mean time, Marcius, is slain,
Shame come.

ROMEO:
Where is my lady?

BENVOLIO:
When I were first my father and daughter.

ROMEO:
A deadly groan, then indeed, that I view
This taken charge: Methinks I see thy brows are both:
O, death's a great disguiser; and so, wallow'd in
Their nicely-gawded leaves. Eyes, look your last!
See, a signior of my brow!
O, cut my lace! let me see!

BENVOLIO:
Who knows not where an executioner comes?

ROMEO:
Thies, cousin, fetch a looking-glass.

BENVOLIO:
Draw, thou torch, thou heaven's black sceptre.

ROMEO:
O, I am too young for that I may not
being a mockery. O, it is not
being, nor to be; I'll still been there.

BENVOLIO:
Tireson, thou art too forward
To say that thou art not mad.

If this rebellious earth, this rebellious earth,
Have any resting, for her seven years shalt know
What royal counsel could the Duke of York hear?

EDWARD:
We must stay the siege of these days,
And, as weester, our fair stars,
Shall come summer'st upon us.

WARWICK:
Where on my knee doth kiss King Henry's heart,
And 'twas his duty tender, his duty,
To monarchize, serve heaven.

RICHARD:
Iron! that was the grace of men
To kings of such gentle lambs,
And peaceable valour!
O, that shameless Warwick had no more respect
In that dim monarchy!

WARWICK:
 glory is not big enough to make the sun
 glorious; and as we think,
Above a bound of lath, or
More than we can, we'll make our some pretty match
To this lady, herself.

GEORGE:
That face of her,
Which shows like grief, but is not so,
To say I draw in these black mean?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, therefore Warwick made peace with her,
And knew her heart as black as
That day had broke his fellows' oaths,
As he himself would not.

WARWICK:
That face of her,
That, Lord of Warwick, by the leave of it,
May mock thee with soing Edward,
Unto the haver and dissembling king.
I think there is not another offended
By this sore trial of York or the crown?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Because your brother of Clarence hate you,
He sententious uncles
Into the brother of Buckingham.

OXFORD:
From Oxford, where he was more abused.

YORK:
I heard him say, Henry, when he had my brother,
He abused me; and not our Henry
Had cursed him.

WARWICK:
When I heard him say, he did not cry,
His praises so mighty,
That not the strong warrant he gave me
The lie: but he gave the lie,
And in the most merciless way
To sovereign Clarence:
'Yea,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the windows,
That even now,I dare clear me with so strong a liar.
O Margaret, Margaret! 'twas thy device
For seest and known too, but not to be so true.

RICHARD:
Your brother not only hath sworn and you more
Than Edward's love and 'dares,
If two more years together.

WARWICK:
Then leave me, my lord. What says Henry now?

GEORGE:
To change my disposition, 'tis but reason that I kneel.

WARWICK:
Yet I wish, that I had been king,
These lands and goods were so rich
That, by the ear of Bordeaux,
I could have been tear'd from the earth.

WARWICK:
Be not me, let me be king; thou shalt not be king.

RICHARD:
Be not, let me be king; I will be queen.

EDWARD:
I am unclesopled, ungentle queen,
If I be not a queen by fortune'st.

WARWICK:
Be not, be ruled by me.

MONTAGUE:
I set my title down and lay me on.

KING HENRY VI:
When I were a king, what was wont to you?

WARWICK:
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
Three of them are dead already, or are they used
By life usurused, by life usurused.

RICHARD:
Have done with words, my lords.

EDWARD:
O my most gracious lord,
By wise words I come, I come:
And therefore take with oath, and with fond delay
To marry them to death!

YORK:
Condend me not; let me embrace thee.

EDWARD:
Sweet love, with the gracious eye of heavy mind
In smooth discourse, and your loving-hearted brother's,
Have embraced the dishonour of the day,
In braided arms ere this bloody homicide.

WARWICK:
God-den to Bolingbroke, as faulted this English king,
By the shunning lion in the night,
Shall cross the seas, and give way unto the execution
Of bloody strokes and mortal-

CLIFFORD:
Ay, by vows unto my party:
The sworn of Brittany, belike,
Hath made thy person for this election.

YORK:
Confirm your loyalty to't, and, as mine honesty puts,
In one that by oath would he were proclaim'd
In every borough as we judge.

KING HENRY VI:
To take all this from Lancaster and home,
And leave us to London one week'd,
To bustle allocund day before the wind
Of England's sun-rise,
Even as thematter did the gods.

WESTMOREL:
That oath is of no moment, being
To rashly purpose. Lord Hastings, how ha!
That oath is of no moment, being given
To imperial whores and to bury charge
To kings and queens; and that we,
ind with the number of the many-yed many,
Amongcours, contended between us,
And have been royally descried
Since we have been thus fearful.

YORK:
Who triumph, then, as we speak
To you, the king?

KING HENRY VI:
What, at my brother's heart?

YORK:
A happy victory, my brother.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me,
If you should live long.

QUEEN MARGARET:
How many children hast thou, widow!

YORK:
Three, my most gracious lord.

GLOUCESTER:

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who is it, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
A happy woman were only to be so young
To comb his youngest in an equal force.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Well, I tell you this:
Your highness told me once should have broken
To hold my peace.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so your highness told me once,
How happy then were your ensuing days!

QUEEN MARGARET:
My lord!

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so you have, so now,--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Princes and noble ladies,
I thank your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
What says your highness to my just demand?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lord, I cannot tell:
My title still some good matter.

KING HENRY VI:
The claim of your highness, by your firm promise:
And therefore, I pray you, let me be your true.

GLOUCESTER:
And then, I pray thee,--
For I will love thee, that know why
To hate thee, that prefer no hatred,
Which thou betray'st not my love.

KING HENRY VI:
Off with my envy, and that high blood
Which valiant Clifford made me give for fence of bosom,
It were not mine, nor my manhood there
Could have choice but branch now. Since these offences
We hate the gentle king, and usurp the close seas,
Which serves theGREEN-bush all the majesty,
We do not know whether he'll or no
That they shall still live.

KING HENRY VI:
The commons will not be satisfied.

GLOUCESTER:
If they do see him, they will murder him.
As that our brother Gloucester did,
Let me tell you, this is All-Souls' face,
Be resident in my tent, and kept by my side.
Cousin of Exeter, had he been a bawd,
High-grown traitor, false and treacherous coward,
To rise the ranks of his proud- meaning,
By sudden mean-applied trial,
Tullus, Marcius sleeping,
Were jocund, and supposed Lucentio,
Where of the insatiate greediness of the gods
Enforceative but had not moved him.

GLOUCESTER:
Then had he stumbled;-methought his height
The sum of mercy for what's past,
From shelves and rocks: now even now
I'll leave my bawd; my heart,
Petruchio's last, by the worth of my descent,
Come kneel by my father's mercy.

KING HENRY VI:
He dies not, but by my soul, by your leave:
Then, setting all this chat aside,
Thus from the more we were, were Henry's friend.

GLOUCESTER:
Look up, here come the house.

Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner:
Ay, my lord.


KING HENRY VI:
And fear?

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me speak.

KING HENRY VI:
Tut, I will not stay,
But I will come; I will follow thee.

Far be it, my lord! why, should I not stay?

KING HENRY VI:
Let me know my duty, and I will look on.

GLOUCESTER:
You shall not be king by your treason,
But by the free man you are queen.

KING HENRY VI:
The duty that I owe to your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this English king;
And to be thus envious was always
To stoop and trANIO:
And to conclude, we have ever best show'd
To you and your royal daughter, the queen's,
The most peer of us--I cannot hold
To tongue so sacred as my soul--
Since you will but know my mind--you must not see
The things I see eye so sweet--
That I may marvel, and desire all
To honour me not.

KING HENRY VI:
O Margaret,
Why art thou patient? thou mayst not I name it?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If you be not in so base afish,
That cannot off call the guilty.

KING HENRY VI:
If I dare tell you where I mean to stay,
First shall I would were at the opening of my brow,
And never will I let in requital to my grief.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Shall we hear from tales
So ill as merry as merry as bear weighty?

KING HENRY VI:
And therefore 'tis breeding, and there springs
From the bosom of the small sea.

GLOUCESTER:
Thus it seems, and is it not known.
Those fifteen years we have been together,
And over a day and many days of happy days,
My most happier years and artan'd were spent,
My most longest age hath been spent,
Shall be the longest grove of ere I could come
Shall be my last.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, how blest my heart
In these smooth days by this!

GLOUCESTER:
Cousin, I were once at your house;
What time of stay had you this presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I could not stay to hear him tell you;
His curses come after:
'Tis death to me to be cruel;
And in extremity we sucking on him.

GLOUCESTER:
Then cursed is urged upon you;
Your prayers do out-pray his: 'Then home, my kind father,
And I will pity you' if you'll prove
That I'll be remembered.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Sound drums and trumpets! and the king will fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Sons, peace!

GLOUCESTER:
What means'st thou, that hangs without thy wall?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Sweet father, by my soul, and my heart.
If you love my daughter, cry 'God,
I show it not.'
And if I think you have done a thing
That does but look big and cold and melancholy.
If I could reach reason
Thy wife felt I heard this:
O, 'twas pity, to glatter;
'Twas trust my daughter's strength with
Who first wounded me, that even now I lost!

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis thanks my lord the king of kings.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And then, all hail to thee!
To your fair name! my father,
And my fair son, my brother;
And all the happy man I am,
Have I not regreet'd my fair stars
To what my tongue can do
I cannot name:
But gloryless are my glories and my eartis witness
Of that report which heaven,
Knowing before we were King Henry's enemies,
May seem so in person to us, and do what grace
We did make

We'll show no badges for these and these
As fancy values them, but keep you,
As over-custom'd custom, by your courtesy, by your stol'n,
And presently by your thanks and leave am come.

KING RICHARD II:
Give me my gage, and I will take it;

Shall win a thousand duteous pupils presently.

Having no more privileges in your sight as I would

Lest you be ignorant of what he is

KING RICHARD II:
O, I thank you, gentle son,
how he lands, I cannot better play
Thean you have, with him thanks and pray,
That I have said farewell:
As gentle as jocund as to jest
Go I to kennel. What needs I
of you?

reload of some turtful son,
That with his grumbling voice
Was wont to desire; therefore follow
you: we'll none of you.

KING RICHARD II:
If I were remember'd,
'Tis by your majesty. Your majesty
Still your good son.' When you were wont to say farewell,
You would tell how my son's son should be dieted
in the table than me?

Tutor:
My lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
What, 'tis my will that we do,
Our duty tender father, and my lustful son:
Too brother died, that might betide
Me; presently he hath lost his holy leaves:
Which, to conclude of truth, might have been more pitiful
an you are mad; and, to conclude,
Consuming means, soon persuade at once,
Our duty tender fatherly virtue hath allay'd,
And therefore, to conclude, which we have to say,
Our royal person be content.

KING RICHARD II:
And that is, Henry's right:
Now, therefore, to speak, I but one word:
Let him be king, or he'll sleep.

QUEEN:
What! he is, and that is Edward's enemy:
But, ere we sleep, we'll suregain some consequence
Tie lead the tongue of banishment and ourselves will.

KING RICHARD II:
Look, what I speak, or see my life destroy'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, I hear that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to another benefice:
Fear not, sweet lord, I speak but as part
I am too tied to be so true and cruel in a
bard to be so tenderly and too proud in virtue!

KING RICHARD II:
We must entreat the other senses of our mind
To come to our counsel and holy thoughts:
So, if powers divine
Had but purpose, as the jealous were our virtues,
'Tis in your debt
And in the debt of Sewot.

GLOUCESTER:
Then, out, and save your thanks by go.

KING RICHARD II:
Stay, let us hence; and farewell, good mother:
We'll not make these wars end too.

CLARENCE:
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it were to be a bier,
not a child, the son of my two cousins;
The precedent and the state of law are both at one.

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient;well my son, farewell: I pray thee,
What is mine?

KING RICHARD II:
Once, sir, why brother Rivers? let my brother
Ere I am cold to make me know my fault:
What circumstances of sudden impatience
My throat requires?

GLOUCESTER:
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, without peril, have a stubbornal
Which they unwashed by his slanderous tongue.
I think it is not his fault:
But what likelihood is not my shame,
To weed my vice out of hand?

KING RICHARD II:

You kiss it, my lord.

LEONTES:

Why, that was when

Ere this hand would buy the blood of the two.

RAPT:
Why, am I dead? 'Tis almost dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet son, the boy gives warning something doth approach.

LEONTES:
What cursed foot wanders this way,
When thou go'st not to the Prince?

GLOUCESTER:
Villain, I know.

RAPT:
Go son, go home with me;
I know you for no kinsman so grieved
To prick my finger, was it not?

GLOUCESTER:
O, I do not know that Englishman alive
Can bear the slanderous blood which thou ne'er did see
In these conflicts of death.

LEONTES:
Thou wast never man this proud man!

GLOUCESTER:
When we were at parting, 'Tis at the Tower.

BENVOLIO:
At the Tower! why, there now:
Ere one place I'll visit the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
And I should, by this good light.

BENVOLIO:
Farewell, my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, good cousin!

BENVOLIO:
I pray you, good madam,--

GLOUCESTER:
He is not here; his castle wall,
Not decked with diamonds and to be seen:
The sceptre were very snow-broth;
The foxe's brow; yet his mortal sting
Had graced the fearful hollow of the dirt;
The very roundness of the hungry plebeians would
Have made him tremble.

BENVOLIO:
That humour know'st the humour of men's mind
But knew not how to call him 'lord:'
 breath, think you.

GLOUCESTER:
That humour often have been used in so foul a fashion,
Because men are nocted to be known;
Yet, since we know thy mind;
Be not till we have known thy mind;
From where you do not sleep, we do not often fly;
For, since we are up in arms,
We cannot stay to our country's cradle,
Tarewell till we can rid the brothers
Of the terror of the two.

BENVOLIO:
For what reason, I beseech you?

GLOUCESTER:
Because my heart cannot brook to speak,
I care not: duty, I cannot brook
To say I love the people.

BENVOLIO:
Why, they say nothing:
Thou shouldst be gone, that I may tarry
Fast foe to my will, and with my sword.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, that is not so.

BENVOLIO:
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet, of whom he is,
His oath enrolled; that he may
Enjoy to know himself.

BENVOLIO:
Who knows the other intent
That I have to be an oath for him to yield?

GLOUCESTER:
The deputy cannot do't; the matter
The matter where he should we do our father good;
The matter whereof, toasts and gentlemen,
I do not know what they can't.

BENVOLIO:
Look where he comes, you know.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, some of you, that knowHow he loves the people
And why he holds up such a troop
As all the sceptres in Bohemia,
And of the welcome and loving commons
To this adventure forth;
Let what is dear God make
Mine-For this unclesed fellow.

My lord, the Duke of Buckingham is dead.

 thy frozen years,
Which here thou wilt shortly mark thy life,
Shall be spent in vain, ere thine honour soil'd:
Why at this rate, being a silly woman,
To bow humble tricks is traditional.
We do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my father, at the twelve am I stol'n,
His son's daughter's son and daughters;
And you shall live anon these fair days
To make a dearth in this revolting land.

We must supplant this.

Should, without the cheers of men,
At least should have come before him,
To braves his body in limbs.

KING LEWIDIUS:
Beseech you, thus, I say,
This executioner shall be found
In the embracements of his body.
 excuse me not:
Whoeseech you, that we will not spare
Our execution?

KING LEWIDIUS:
There is some blame.

SICINIUS:
We will to the Capitol.

BROKE:
We will be there,
Where, our first cousins, we'll show
What dangers, by this time,
We desire the obedience which we do owe
To endure the wanton cold ways,
Which we will not spare us,
But come the next way home.

BUSHY:
You'll mar all the lace and weight
For so your father's sake so he should,
Because, brother, we'll arm us all;
But we will bear thy blame, which will owe
To him, poor brother, to his sick
And therefore, I pray thee, news indifferent
What is the news.

Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should, if a coward heard
Sire had him, a virtuous and upright gentleman.

Methinks we should, but not be shut

No way to right with her, but to

to pluck all tongues and talk their emulation.

PETRUCHIO:
Are there no manners between?

KATHARINA:
Yes, with this, for she will not be about me

and therefore shall I have way to way, to be thought

She is the courageous captain of my bed and I thank you.

As you were all undaught.

I will be happy with you for this deed.

PETRUCHIO:
You show too much of him, a friend, and not of your heart.

KATHARINA:
Father, 'tis none of you;
But you have been kind, with me amongst the store,
Upon my stops to the way in the journey.

PETRUCHIO:
O cheerful return! Petruchio, how came you hither?

BAPTISTA:
At the garden of Pisa.

PETRUCHIO:
And not there, why we were so met?

BAPTISTA:

Perhaps you have not used the holy seal
Nor cheque'd the vice so.

For this to the end of opposed thoughts,--

And I shalt send him certain word to-morrow,
When he did hear of our Marcius' banishment,

VOLUMNIA:
Now God's word is short as December,
Even as short as an hour

Masters o' the people,

That Marcius should,
Though bearing misery,

MENENIUS:
O, you are too absolute
In this so-called.

COMINIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may live one hour in your sweet bosom,
There's some differency between us;
The moon smiles not in the very moon,
The smallest moon shines by night:
Besides, the odds.

MENENIUS:
What is the matter, you make your eyes
Stain'd with our thanks and thanks?

COMINIUS:
Because 'gainst us, you are too absolute
In this so business.

MENENIUS:
If so, then the people's will beOur witness to
The lawful tribunes' pleasure.

COMINIUS:
Yet, say, Marcius,
Who is the noted god of our assembly?

MENENIUS:
The very god of our assembly,
And our most trust of chastisement.

MARCIUS:
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

COMINIUS:
And so, I pray thee, lay aside your stitchery;
Let him have no more conference with you;
For if you show him our general livery,
Our general will be gracious to endure your censure,
And show your general livery.

First Senator:

But you have not the cunning to conceal our meaning,
For the rather we must think you master, hide our meaning,
How our meaning hath been to jest by them.

MENENIUS:
That is too much,
Since we meaning to keep our meaning.

First Senator:
But, to conclude with truth, it is more must be said,
Than to would you have been so mean.

MENENIUS:
To be to base, we'll sure down.

BRUTUS:
To base our senators by you:
You must know
The people are grown most kind of wit
In the people's treasury.

MENENIUS:
That will be no more:
You must help to take all care,
To deck our senators by your form.

Against infection and the hand of war,

At the battles of London,
and all are due to me.

WARWICK:
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as my judge,
That, had I come to the whole depth of my thought,
I should have found myself in Mowbray
To never had a taste of her own again.
A twofold death as great, to want,
When Dighton cannot fly no further;
A thousand-barr'd many years, as high as near
As the sun. Who doth gaunt us, villains, flatter?
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
Methinks the nobility of the throne,
Smile the dust that is King Clifford's enemy,
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
No, Bolingbroke, thou speak'st not what is bloody;
For, were he revenged for this time,
Even for revenge mock Bolingbroke.

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you make my hate, and have my wish
To marry me before my king?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Good my lord, and a black oath is of no moment
To make the Lord Duke of York proud:
He is our king, and we may rise,
To him our lawful king.

KING EDWARD IV:
And must our loving mother think
How sweet a princely son were brother he were,
Even as the blood and line of our father,
Look on his forces with ruthless looks,
And wildly hurl'd on us, as if
We revel much that we think of you.
If your bodies and the appetite of our friends prove
To taste of brotherhood, then be not vain;
For, but look up of brotherhood,
Yet if hearts can bear a frown, they will feast us all;
And Nero will be cross in talk,
To comfort all under Mercury,
Were he, as eldest male to the womb,
And disinherited of by our strange son.
These happy masks were not the time,
Since what they kiss'd me on the head of Richard.
See, ruthless queen! humbly she melted, nor:
See, ruthless queen! humbly she melted, nor will not speak a word;
Until her tears were equal
As Juno's parting with her burnt hand:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
That look'd after the ridges of her frowns,
Come Lammas's grief, whose resolution to-day
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what she could do;
She did but smile, and I seeing,
Such false and unnatural aspect
To monarchize, be fear'd and at:
Such is the daughter of the Lord Stanley.
'Tis this is indeed the queen's fault,
That we may arm us to this being fear'd,
With downright payment.
Now, since my mind of what fear and what sorrow can
Most procure to endure the worst,
That is, a child, I'll arm me many years
In grace and favour of my kin;
For, to arms! myself confound!
All times of day shall stop here,
And aid thee with my troops of wrath and warful day.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Stay, go, and tell the rest.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take no more:
What, shall we go?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Return, as where you stand on our right,
To avoid the envy you make me beg the worse:
Think you my sons and brother are gone;
And therefore I'll never be so long absent.

KING EDWARD IV:
Will you hear:
He hath not told me of your succession?

QUEEN MARGARET:
He is, my lord, and I fear:
Because I am old and sick, like you,
Must yet tell me of joy that I have been
To you and your brother, that with my misery
Must joy be found in me, but grief of heart
Environ'd.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, of all mischance, arise so hither:

Then know not why I was once to be so heighten'd

By thy taming virtue's other disposition,

We'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Hark, my lord! I thought, some two days
From me and by my close were,
Not what my lord will wear;
But what he, that am not my husband,
Is, as some fathers' midwife,
Some girl there are happy mothers made,
Their veryure of the earth,
For some have not seen them.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:

But, soft, heavy, my lord,
Thy honour knows me not.

No, I'll not be long;
I'll back with thee in strong as on a bear.

When I am bigger, I will lay myself,
Where no longer stay till I am bigger.

BUSHY:
'Tis not to me; who knows I am?

GREEN:

Above the moon: I'll lean unto the nay,
And never will look on her face nor cheek
the fair stars with her sighs; but I will
take the moon with thee, being the poor thing is
I am too bold, too fat, too wise, wisely
For such eyes over-shine'd, that I, being but

If King Richard and the true king down,
Yea to his mercy, and your gentle Lady,
Will both be satisfied and happy mothers
Cry mercy, I thee mercy and I thee mercy.

GLOUCESTER:
Father, you cannot disollog the stars with stars:
Look, if I am king, where my duty is
To make a pedigree
Of threescore and two years' worth.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My lord, you cannot disemit me:
If you be king, why should not me;
Because, by giving me glory, you are content
To make a shameless woman my father:
I am content to be your queen,
Because I am content:
I speak comfortable words and holy thoughts
Shall feed on needful kings.

So it his enemies are all, as some would seem to him,
That, were they to be thought at once,

If I report him by myself.

Or what is worst will follow.

The noble heir of the Lord York and

Ay, to be so cowards;
For from our heart's love I see
Thy exercise, my fearful duty tender George.

YORK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, gentle prophet, to his foe no more
Than those that chased you from the noise of our way.

WARWICK:
But follow me, gentle Earl of France.

Nay, follow me, lords. I say that idle weeds are
The very epitIN of my fortune and your succession:
And you, that are the queen of this brave Plantagenet,
Where will I live, I'll never shall be higher
With that report which I so often have fought.

WARWICK:
Now, therefore speak as thou wis.

CLIFFORD:
In giving so charge, and with declining head,
Be blamed the king, and he will not live,
But thou shalt use your jealous eye and your witness
To doom and goasure of not moving towards him.

YORK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. Why, therefore comes my brother?
Attend me, lords. The boy looks so pale,
Such as the enemies' midwifery:
Which if I thought it were a happy life,
'The he bear won me;' the he got me;
And I'll hurl on his gage
To weed my envy with his report:
Despite of all the sceptres are up,
Where doubt not right, but to acquose I myself.

MONTAGUE:

To see my friends and my body's Seeer.

And twelve thousand, as most they were,

And still winter in the watery pursuit,
For the next grain or two is Angelo.

And live with unstain'd bones.

But very partial affection: close.

Which will accuse us to be put to know,
And make us accusation and put to death.

For he is the greatest thing about him.

If they'll hear me swear to be believed,

For what he does, I am his soldier.

And his authority of the foot
Of our design, to be so content
To suffer lawful censure.

For though they can admit no, yet are they passing
To speak as free from touch or soil.

And I do not know where.

And we may soon persuade them.

And I'll one--when he is found.

And the people mutinous; and it is impossible
To be held, by the disguised.

And Rome gates with Romans and patricians,
Holy Apollo,Vouchsafe, to furnish us
Our friendly friends with the power of slaves,

If, as they say, Marcius:

If he could burn us all into one coal,
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by heaven;
For fools use the folly of the people.

We have stood as opposite to every good
To him as you proud, so without
The cloak and instruct.

That we were all, as some would seem to do,
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

MENENIUS:
The other, when he did the people's good,
He let it soundly. All my ministers
Becomes him to resign; and, if Marcius chance to woo,
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
Because he could put us to power and come too late
To prick the clouds of Caucasus.

Shall I be hated by the people of this?

BRUTUS:
We'll make an instrument of law to do
Nothing but that is ill policy,
And only therefore law.

MENENIUS:
If that be not too much, make peace:
Nor' must we make like enemies.

BRUTUS:
I know by where he should mean difference,
If our brother way were equal.

MENENIUS:
If there be not too much,
We'll make an instrument
To't.

COMINIUS:
Ay, brother,--

BRUTUS:
For Rome.

MENENIUS:
Well, he must not so.

BRUTUS:
Pray, get you to your house;
You must be back'd to them and kept without my house:
I'll kindle, come on, go on your honour:
Though the nature of our people be great,
You are not China.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled by him.

BRUTUS:
When he does climate here,
We need not to wait on him.

MENENIUS:
If he do climateally descried
Thereof no more needful an eye than hat,
Pray, give him leave to go
Where he shall show us all our faults, and show
The kind of his faults, our general:
He shall not perceive us
But we are made to endure
With no man is contented.

MENENIUS:
Sir, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth
Our Rome hath not been ought to.

First Senator:
Leave me your snatches, and yield me a
burthen: I'll copy
me these articles, to look
and see my design. All good men,
Cry mercy, sir!

MENENIUS:
O sir!

SICINIUS:
We will.

BRUTUS:
I cannot but call them home.

MENENIUS:
Where is it?

BRUTUS:
See how he holds up.

SICINIUS:
When he stands where he stands, then let us perceive
His faults in them, and tell them
His noble tribunes for them!

BRUTUS:
What's o' him?

SICINIUS:
He's in the right.

MENENIUS:
That fellow is a poor fellow's child,
Whose report is but to be envy,
Young, he is more pitiful
Than was the more gentleman born.

SICINIUS:
Be not scruched for your height
Before this goodly boy mine.

MENENIUS:
Tie but because he be three-time-old,
Come not to us.

COMINIUS:
No, good sir,--

To our physician and her allies
Against infection and the hand of war,
Against the wind of waters,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
And lasting war.

WARWICK:
Convey it, Henry, and with all speed
To soldiers and subjects:
Henry now is lying in Marseilles' road,
With unrestrained loose companions;
Even as the night before,
Against infection and the affection common
Of civil enmity;
Which then the gallant lion cannot spare,
That his lady mourns.

KING HENRY VI:
O, but they say Edward is deposed;
For they say that he is,
Our king's majesty's due by life usurp'd,
Our king not privy: what if we fear the eagle
That made you fearful of his life?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If I fear him,
I'll show him our duty; but if else,
We'll show ourselves our title to his majesty.
Therefore, we thank you, gentle Warwick, and trouble not
To put our title in his virtue.

WARWICK:
Yet I wish, that all were well,
I had been more fortunes safe when a king.

GEORGE:
When I am slain, then no more pains
To his majesty than his honour!
When you are absent, why give I leave
To live when Warwick is in place?

WARWICK:
Even when you please him and yours;
For then I blame you not your blits
To stay all together: I would not
The time and the king's.

GEORGE:
I pray, therefore, let us stand aside.

KING HENRY VI:
Ah, Exeter!

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick now beies proud with patience.

OXFORD:
Now therefore the gates shall be open, and quickly.

WARWICK:
Ridings and Hastings, you were like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage.

KING HENRY VI:
But reason with me, lords; I would not be his son
Till our request two cousins had left earth.

EDWARD:
No, Warwick's brother ishead but nine months old:
I was adopted heir by his consent and my daughter's
Trusting to him and me, and then by my father's fair blood,
which Henry was unfortunate.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother, to be talk of
What you should say must answer.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting prince,
Montague, and the haught insulting queen,
All these our friends to you; and therefore follow me,
To way the common people down.

WARWICK:
What then?

MONTAGUE:
Their neck be seven thousand years together, and their land
Nine years together: down, down, to stretch
ones shall be the longest mo piece.

EDWARD:
Marry, therefore therefore, be patient.

MONTAGUE:
Your brother is dead already, and your blood
Hath beended betagged with your bed.

WARWICK:
But 'twas never where is your brother?

MONTAGUE:
Where it seems best to be the chiefer
when he were young and how foul and effectless,
EDWARD:
But when the sun rose, your brother's head;
Your brother's head, your brother's head;
And what your brother's hatarel well,
That were your adopted heir,
and the adopted heir of our downwinds,
Now Phaethon, at once put down this fortress of mine,
And bid me nightly in a dream,
That I should be thus bescreen'd,
confusing me forgetting,
into the Tower.

YORK:
Three-hours since I saw the prince,
If any where I expect'd him.

MONTAGUE:
But he's dead: off, to-morrow,
And by good fortune last I had him.

EDWARD:
But then his enemies will be taken and he's dead:
And, till I know where and how he is,
To all the bloody service of the foot
Which he so dread.

YORK:
'Tis his high ancestor, pent-up lion o' the womb,
From whence we came the post ofPlis,
The son of old Henry the Fifth,
Who made heir of me

MASTY:
If she had any grandsire to be a judge
For wise modesty, as 'twere all alike,
Thou wouldst not regreet her judged but
Be blamed, as she is proud to depose.

BRUTUS:
O, she is the woman of the house.

MENENIUS:
If she had been as virtuous and as dangerous
To stain the temper of mine honour, you should pardon
Your honour.

BRUTUS:
I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.

COMINIUS:
A holy mother! Happy wife attend on
!

VOLUMNIA:
I pray now, call her.
What most worthy will you make?

MENENIUS:
One of them? one.

VOLUMNIA:
For aught, worthy a guest
As all the gods look unple.

MENENIUS:
You'll mar him to your wife,
And call her by your goate.

First Senator:
Noble Marcius!

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, let's make haste.

MENENIUS:
Aray!

SICINIUS:
Put them in secret holds, both
To look at each other.

BRUTUS:

Citizensitizens:
Your honour not depends on your desires,
But he must think, if he could burn us all,
From whence we came.

MENENIUS:
If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good Marcius,
One of these--

SICINIUS:
One, two, they know,
The senate, an't o' the senate,

Thou art perfect then, our ship is tired,
And we'llched to our shore.

MENENIUS:

How she presenteth, as the people did
In our Coriolanus.

But you do not mind the pale moon,
The adulterate use of unquiet slanders.

MENENIUS:
If so,
You show too much of this. All
Your enemies are fled to him, and your friends are fled;
To cross the seas of Rome.

COMINIUS:
Do not stand upon't.

MENENIUS:
No, say not me:
If you refuse respect how you should arraign me
As I do the gods, I will plead
As you were tied in duty.

CORIOLANUS:
It were as like as my former time,
When you did speak to the people,
Your purpose so ill-applied: filling
Your musty.

MENENIUS:
O,
You must report to the people hearing.

BRUTUS:
The people will remain uncertain whilst
We do talk; and so shall not
Come down to speak.

MENENIUS:
If so,
We'll give them thanks, to our thanks, and make
Our thanksgreat to the Romans.

First Senator:
We will,
And be their own, so we may,
Set down our state of bodies, to show
The people these dead men.

HERMIONE:
So she may, my lord, to have some conference with his grace.

LEONTES:
Well, he must do not shame to hear himself.

HERMIONE:
If I had a heart as little apt as his,
As I am, I would tear the word.

LEONTES:
Thou mayst not speak of that thou art so ill:
He shall not sit there, never will be talked withal.

HERMIONE:
The hair on't, thou wilt say 'th to me;'
I am the poor thing, and I fear thee not:
Because I am not the father to my son,
I cannot say 'th to me;' but by guess.

LEONTES:
Thou, by thisstock'st, thou surest not
The burthen of this eye.

HERMIONE:
By this hand, I will not say 'th to me;'
But, that was better than 'twere.

LEONTES:
'Tis like to be so, because both of us had been
some stair-work: sure, I heard this in the
afternoon.

HERMIONE:
That's no worse, sir than one who heard it.

LEONTES:
Mum.

HERMIONE:
If he were dead, say he had drunk.

LEONTES:
Saw you no more?

HERMIONE:
If he be in, I would not put him i' the market-place.

LEONTES:
 I do see that I may be in buyer:
Eleven years I spent to see him last night;
But how to stay, that you may but
walk my son's body body with my amleen.

MAMILLIUS:
Let's to this end, and bid the like language
To cheque our hearts with that victorious arm.

HERMIONE:
If that thy weary hand would spy out our labour,
This hand should, with the most cruel threatening look,
Yet that, that be in so still and bent.
Cousin, I charged thee that she should not stumble,
And, as she fell, didst not think me so pale.

MAMILLIUS:
Who comes with him?

HERMIONE:
O, belike, look where he stands between two sets!

LEONTES:
Where kings set, and are stud'd on!
A double worship, bound to one place,
Where one another, one another, to another,
Some set down in the upper end of their throne,
The one at the other: must our holy thoughts
Give way unto her,
That living mortals, unintelligent of our meaning,
Might with our large lives win and great dignity,
Which, for this time, we will continue.

LEONTES:
Where that do you mean to bide the poor soul?
The one being dead, the other when it is found
I'll make known to the purpose.

HERMIONE:
I would thou wert so too!

LEONTES:
Thou wouldst be more pitiful by this stay,
To one that means his heir, and you not.

HERMIONE:
To one poor sire
And choke that feed makes no excuse current,
Then crave a favour at your highness'
With him so young, and with that honour,
. were it not pity that he should
complain of late, that he so long
To prick my finger till his son
Should come in his liking?

FLORIZEL:
Very well:
When he did see my son's son, he let me tell him
A pretty tale: but had I
Once more I heard it, when he had plotted
A noble death, that he supposed,
A fearful man was plotted,

The noble return'd to you;
And yet the yield of no doubt his majesty
To faithful service of your majesty.

LEONTES:
How he mammocked my angry son!
Now, my soul, my fault, my gasping soul!
Why,, such a thought of such a thought!
When, I cannot brook the flatter'd
flowers in his smoking blood,

But basely, sick, remorseless,
I would he had my will,
Release me from his native duty,
Or bid me glory, if I revel

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yea, but not change his spots: take but such pride
To see my glory picture how: at such delicate,
As doth mine, I give my lord, majesty,
To be more known and thankful for my humility.
Must Edward fall down, whence did I leave?

RICHARD:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No, if I revolt, 'tis not revenge sufficient
For Edward's sake.

WARWICK:
Commend me to Lord William: tell him privily
That Edward is escaped from your side,
And is guerdon'd, as some would seem to be,
If Warwick, and the Lady Bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now breathe we, lords: good hope must hinder
The Duke of Clarence to your side,
Unto a seated man by war.
I, that am Duke of Clarence,
But Edward Duke of Clarence, nor any of your nine,
In double violation of chastisement--
To-morrow are to-day:
To-day is to-day.

CLARENCE:

OXUEUEUEEN:
To-morrow: bid us joy, cause!

KING LEWIS XI:
But stay, until eating and feeding be past.

QUEEN:
How many children hast thou, widow?

CLARENCE:

QUEEN:
Three, my most gracious lord;
And by my count, I should count myself
To one seven and one, Lord Rivers, and to that end.

GLOUCESTER:
My Lorday, have mercy, my lord; I must report.

KING RICHARD II:
Bid my son good: I must indeed,
In asking the Lady Bona on thy suit,
Which thou, by my leave of it, hath thrice a day,
To happy purpose.

QUEEN:
What happy deed is this of hers?

She is of declining, retired, say I,
Where she is not sleeping, consumed with fire,
What she envied, that this methought,
For I will hence forthwith unto Westminster
To see these lands and these lands.

GLOUCESTER:
To be to them and not your king.

KING RICHARD II:
Leave out, be gone, be strong and prosperous in your sort.

QUEEN:
I pray God that all were well,
When you were king.

KING RICHARD II:
O, bear, my lord, I bear,
Upon my right hand.

QUEEN:
I'll to Ireland, to see these wars
How far hence, that once there shall stand
Ere once more his majesty liege.

KING RICHARD II:
Where will you make us in our parliament,
Where you shall be employ'd, and on our way
Ourself our loyal subjects sworn
To tread the gentle shadow of your adversaries?

YORK:
Where now, my lord, thou know'st
That Edward is your title to the English king?

KING RICHARD II:
Under penalty, whereon I may live,
If you will encounter the inveter.

YORK:
That I do envy your majesty
For being too mean a subject for myself:
Because, by you's report, you heard
That Edward had no more must say
Than is the noble heir of Henry's right.
But, were it not so, thou justly,
Then didst make my brother Richard look
And speak as if he did contemn.

WARWICK:
Where is Warwick then but one subject?
Where were his enemies, and his followers?

WARWICK:
Are they not kings?

KING RICHARD II:
If they be, where is the Duke of York,
The duke my brother, Edward's physician,
Post by new act of parliament what they are?
You make a leg, if you will, and go about with him.

YORK:
if I were not in this thick-grown spider,
will I make my cross-work'd flesh for your defence.

KING RICHARD II:
The art thouThat Margaret's eyes did scorn at this meeting:
She is as wise as virtuous as the vice that Margaret
 disdain'd the top of chivalry, as the bow who he is
To jest, and pray as the manner of his inclination.

YORK:
His neck will come to your tent:
======================================== SAMPLE 105 ========================================

This is All-Souls' day to me!

EDWARD:
If thou be a man, why dost thou show
This lance to the fight?

WARWICK:
Why, brother,
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
When you were young Henry.

MARIANA:
But I am doubtful: you might be some more
Or some more: I cannot tell;
For I dare be sworn to you
Where you are not.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, thou wilt say God is my enemy.

YORK:
Why, how should best beseems thee!

WARWICK:
Well word thee not.

KING HENRY VI:
What! cry 'Saint George!'
Or, if thou mean'st, beut
I am thy true heir; and I swear
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
And that thou wilt be hated thereby
Whereof I live.

 MARIANA:
Let me peruse this: thou shalt think
I have been disloyal to thy bed,
 where I will show myself.

KING HENRY VI:
Remember, as thou read'st,
That I may, by Him that read
My name of kings' reign I'll ascend the regal throne,
Where no man mock me with my gage,
Therein thou wrong'st.

YORK:
Think'st thou that I am heir to thee?

KING HENRY VI:
No, thou art not so by hand, as gage
Did, but by the action of thy captain.

WARWICK:
Be thou revenged on men and by man;
For I were made to be at charges
When I supposed you were succession.

EDWARD:
He that retires I now
To call you brother, let me call you brother.

MONTAGUE:
Why that I live this time of nights,
When I desire the thing of revenge,
To be so tender to be at enmity
With child, widow, and this most patient,
Though I be youngest, give me leave
To play the fortune of the people's mind
To reap the least, to study and fast.

YORK:
Why, brother, where's brother, thou now?

KING HENRY VI:
I pray thee not; therefore be patient.

MONTAGUE:
Nay, rather, gentle monarch, be still.

PRINCE:
My royal self, why, I should be the king's friend,
and I were his adopted heir, should be
As kingly heir to Henry's heart.

YORK:
Be royalty like all men; and be content
To what is yielded to:
Be ruled by me, and let go back.

WARWICK:
This oath I willingly take and will perform.

YORK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

KING HENRY VI:
Be England's king! and he will remain
Our England's true subjects.

YORK:
AndLong live God and honour!

WARWICK:
And I, our queen!

YORK:
Now God and these our brothers York and Lancaster,
Have vow'd long to make us happy, York king!

YORK:
And have you happy words, that thou help'st us not?

Now, these those that we have done make,
To make us happy, would I have been down,
At once would I could stand by,
And not have been breathing here.

KING HENRY VI:
Brothers, you make me happy: never dancing,
But learn to serve me last, by your dancing soul.

YORK:
I would I were returned!

KING HENRY VI:

Sweet York, and the lustful bed I lay,
This hand, this love, commanded,
Hath made me happy by my soul.

YORK:
How many children hast thou, widow?

KING HENRY VI:
Three, my most gracious lord.

CLIFFORD:
Believe me, I would they were twenty!

YORK:
Three, I would they were twenty!

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that I could fly ere this favour.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, 'twas pity of him,
That hand, like a man, did kill thy love!

YORK:
Thy heart is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

I would thou

Brother of Gloucester, at once
Uncase thee; then once again
Uncase thee! why, then turn tears to fires;
And say, what's this?

WARWICK:
Seal up theenting fire
With purple-sucking sighs, as these
That lay the trees bedwn in the sun
AndDo through they to taste of trees.

Seal up the candles all, and let noses cleanly
I' the sun; and, if I revolt,
Cold steel grows soft as the wind.

KING HENRY VI:
What is the matter this ruthless lord?

SURREY:
He hath on him, and will make every lane to-morrow
Hast had no notice of these accidents;
When he didcarouse me his soldiers faint
And put put his own men on the point of mercy.
I cannot tell what safe till I were
If he did remember my troop.

SURREY:
'Tis almost done, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Go, take these garments to you.
If you be gentlemen, why cease we'll have them;
For we'll lay the iron on us,
And when we have stuff'd all night
Shall keep the body of the wearers.

SURREY:
We thank you, gentle uncle. O,
Yet I wish I still winter's discontent.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
By the fall of leaf, means I have look'd upon
The corn I have, you and my young son!

YORK:
Ay, but thou must not so:
Under your canopy I heard him say
ay, but he was torn to death,
Which upon the very siege of my breast,
His prayers to me and my soul;
That had not been spake, he should have been
The grave of mercy, but that very siege,
Who attended his rapture as some alive
At some few hours in pain, I would have been
The advocate, flinty, rough, remorseless.

KING HENRY VI:
O, pray, know you this?

YORK:
The privilege that I dearly love!

KING HENRY VI:
I know it, and have look'd on it.

EXETER:
Before I cry out, I partly see the play.

KING HENRY VI:
O, the citizens are not wont to be talked withal,
Nor I, that am tied to be obedient.

YORK:
Why, so I am, in this humour, I will show myself
The people's officer.

KING HENRY VI:
Bear with those that say thou art good to Rome,
And let them tell you where you will be lopp'd
In your own voices. This is All-Souls' day,
'Tis some conceit or invention.

Lieutenant:
Arm, weapons, saints!

KING HENRY VI:
Come, come, you will not what you mean to rise,
But follow the first.

YORK:
Mine honour and your goodness makes my hate:
If Irown to your worships, I will lay myself,
Where I thought you should you did you did not.

KING HENRY VI:
Then have at your majesty
A just and still-chosen spirit,
Shall say against me, and let me live.

YORK:
I go.

KING HENRY VI:
I will some mean-born man,
Whither I am going with my thoughts
Shall come to your tent-fire this afternoon by t'other,
Tullus, Gregory, Philip, whom here you talk of had
Hath power enough to serve my turn.

EXETER:
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

KING HENRY VI:
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?

YORK:
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day, shall slay;
And to-morrow, fearful to my soul.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of him.

YORK:
Who is't that is, that is, I'd,
The king?

KING HENRY VI:
The duty that I owe to thee and to his allies
Shall be your fault, unless I'll be revenged.

Then thereto were writ, that it may be,
By foul token.

ESCALUS:
If for this, how heinous e'er it beseems thee
To pardon me! yet for mine eyes are infected
With remorse and deep integrity.
I never look'd for guilty when I was found
False to this my lord nor guilty of any harm
To any; but when I wander'd and I look'd upon,
I never thought so big and daring, nor no one of this kind

ESCALUS:
How.

ELBOW:
That mercy which I warn thee,
Tullus Aufidius, is another name of mercy,
Which was once little better to pit and severity,
Than was the severity of the public power
That lent it.

And I will sure on him.

We'll bury you where you were tied in duty,
And show'd you the scars which you may--
For no more standing, I'll scarce believe
How that you may.

This afternoon, sir? there is such ado to make
nothing but stopp.

ANGELO:
My lord, some minute ere you were born,
Here in the parliament, what cut off you can you think
You are the porter, my lord
======================================== SAMPLE 108 ========================================


GLOUCESTER:
Lord thy royal presence?

GLOUCESTER:
Thomas.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis not so, for I hear his praise:
If he praise me, I will give him thanks
As mercy does, for he is my kind.

KING HENRY VI:

Clarence, excuse me to the king:
My brother is right welcome hither;
And I respected with him before I was pleased:
So then the heavens continue their loves!

GLOUCESTER:
If the Lady Grey had any other medicine
By your strange marriage, as 'twere, thou wouldst be more pitiful.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, I shame to hear this mockery.
If not, I'll give thee mine duty,
As have the gods, I tell tell thee.

GLOUCESTER:

KING HENRY VI:
Methinks I shame to hear this mockery.

GLOUCESTER:
Not willing to be thus bold in charge
To accuse and to approve by your coming hither.

KING HENRY VI:
If your mindets, and that high All-Seer
That I desire to hear of!

GLOUCESTER:
Evenes; I envy your highness' due so.

KING HENRY VI:
I'll ha' thee burnt. I pray thee, let me' see:
The prayers of holy men cannot appease
Me; for they are mock'd with glats,
To be received deadlyly.

GLOUCESTER:
O holy Richard!

KING HENRY VI:
Hast thou heard this holy know?

GLOUCESTER:
O holy man! the blood he hath shed
That hath not offended the king;
For who miscarried he cries to me;
And what was done, he would not:
The crown, which he would command,
The people's magarums,
All proofs sleeping, are nowRelable:
If this angry man do throughly consents,
Be thou the Hector that was wont to conquer,
And serve his death with words advanced'd weapons.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I thought my intent to revenge
My hate fully out of him.

GLOUCESTER:
The thought of thy coming hither changed:
And what 'twere, that was to so noble a purpose,
And what 'twas, to be murder'd by another.
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
Which being spotted with our graves and these our years,
Shall tear us above the ground:
Or let us stand into Ravenspurgh,
To cross the lost night front with the grissel,
And beg and like graves
Where noETH: yet for the joy of York
Shall make us uncles' night;
Till time lend friends and fair days, and long live.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin you shall go with me;
To stay with me, or else not to stay,
Till we may think you'll sure to leave you.

KING HENRY VI:
If 'gainst yourself, be ruled by me.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
No, to be ruled by him.

GLOUCESTER:
When, I am youngest, give me leave,
You make but serve the elder: so, pray you, let me be your follower;
And you, that are your husband, rise and serve all;
To come, you brother: be stol'n upon you;
Yourself your subjects sworn your true duty.

KING HENRY VI:
I do not mean to part with thee;
Here come your fathers' sons and be accused.

BUCKINGHAM:
You do me wrong, and I dearly love my children.

KING HENRY VI:
You are marvellous forward, my lord,
To this supposed, you lie:
Towards three or four o'clock, theclock in the quarter.

GLOUCESTER:
Look, what the early village-cock with his son,
His tears apparent'd in the street,
And all so soon as the all-cheering sun could war
Shall larch out all his country's black veil,
And make a dearth in the silk-work:
If I cannot, by the 'tis shall all as quickly.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, this is nothing but a question:
The shadow of your majesty, and the

 oppression
Give Romans and a man of pity.

MENENIUS:
Why, so, neither: your honours have done
To worthy service.

BRUTUS:

MENENIUS:
It is your honours,
You never with heed.

BRUTUS:
For we to come, you never with heed
But think you had not crossed?

MENENIUS:
Why, no?

BRUTUS:
For we to leave you, and speak for our excuse,
For we to leave you o' the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Be it so; go home, be ruled:
Be ruled by me; forget to think of me.

BRUTUS:
We'll mar them and lead our Rome.

MENENIUS:
And I'll leave your honours all.

BRUTUS:
Who does your bawdy heart?

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
The bawdyed many years,
When you were a curler o' the wars?

BRUTUS:
You know your title to the Capitol:
MENENIUS:
So, neither.

BRUTUS:
The bawdyed many years,
When you were last in Holborn.

MENENIUS:
That's a noble fellow.

BRUTUS:
The bawdyed me?

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Why, so, almost.

BRUTUS:

Bawdy! I am a poor fellow.

MENENIUS:
Why, that's a poor fellow,
The bawdy is at the nett.

BRUTUS:
'Tis a bawdy fellow;
I would he had some more beard when last we spake together.

MENENIUS:
 This fellow, I cannot tell:
he breastily consents.

BRUTUS:
The bawdyed bride and countrymen,
The bridegroom wants
To term them bawdy.

MENENIUS:
Bawdy! bride!

BRUTUS:
How! do you know this is your will,
And we will not stand to't.

MENENIUS:
The will not be?

BRUTUS:
Will't please your queen to send the babe,
Before your son? you must wait;
For we must weigh her by herself.

MENENIUS:
If she agree, 'twere needful I replied to her.

BRUTUS:
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.

SICINIUS:
Such it seems
As may be in doubt, but with her double vigour.

BRUTUS:
But where is this fellow?

MENENIUS:
You must be so black, so boar.

BRUTUS:
Not Bohemia, son, nor England's queen,
Which he makes.

MENENIUS:
Pray, be his name to me: go to him,
And pluck him o' the head.

BRUTUS:
You must be black, and then your honour soil'd;
And in the chair of your duty all encreated
Your servant to the next duty:
What you have done, and now what are those
That we to back?

MENENIUS:
His name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
'Tis Marcius,
Who did our part therein.

BRUTUS:
Tullus writes, Marcius,
How; and already content.

MENENIUS:
So.

BRUTUS:
He cannot choose.

MENENIUS:
No, he comes not.

BRUTUS:
ANGentle hearing him!
He would not seem to me, I fear:
Upon my power I think I had frown'd him.

ESCALUS:
Well, what then?
He looks as clear of the state,
As I am now unhappy; and so I think
All cause unborn, could never be
But to be so young and so young:
Yet, as I can of his affections,
Gentle from me, and from another dignity,
First instruction from truth: sure,
when he did sit in the stocks refuge I look'd upon:
What then?

MENENIUS:
That's my poor son's face,
Who smiles whilst I mount on the other:
I think
You should not be satisfied

Lord:
He hath made me four and twenty nose-blood;
sucking sighs, I can tell you. O king!
Thy father was a poor gentleman born.

YORK:
Thy brother slain, thyself at home.

--GEORGE:
But I be doubtful:
These woes will never lie again.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll bear thee happy, being the better.
O Margaret, you will not bear me so heavy,
Having been more pitiful.

RICHARD:
O All-cheering, I can tell thee where I was done
In bloody days: yet I bear a son,
So strong as his enemies use to tame.

YORK:
Art thou that Duke of York, that we can trust?

EDWARD:
If he be dead, 'tis not that I have.

YORK:
Thy brother's death, that I have.

EDWARD:
He is, my lord.

YORK:
Thy brother's death, that we can fancy.

RICHARD:
O that he were alive!

YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

EDWARD:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

YORK:
No; God will revenge me:
I would I had been a king by the doing it.

RICHARD:
And shall I live, I hope to live.

YORK:
What counsel, lords? Edward will always yield to immoderateChop.

WARWICK:
Chop off his head: poor living corse!

YORK:
If your high will take order Buckingham be with you
And bring the power of the king to send the rest.

WARWICK:
Commend me to Henry, king; let him be king;
I'll claim by conquest to him.

KING HENRY VI:
In God's name, speak.

WARWICK:
What else?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how now, my lord! what else?

WARWICK:
About this, that is pleasing; but can you tell me.

CLIFFORD:
About this, that 'twixt heaven and earth.

KING HENRY VI:
My lord, I dare tell you; but how it will,
The people will not be satisfied.

YORK:
Mine honour is the matter;
The king's name is left undone.

KING HENRY VI:
Pardon me, lords; I will lay down to sleep.
Let me entreat of him and trouble you no more.

YORK:
What else?

KING HENRY VI:
Let me entreat of you majesty
To come to what I can command.

YORK:
I am tied to hell and will to sleep.

KING HENRY VI:
I'll lay down this body in some hole,
Until another world or two days old.

YORK:
i' God's name and the king's,
And will you walk abroad, where you may live.
DORSET:
Yea, and not without a freer heart.

KING HENRY VI:
I swear I'll not die, unless your highness grant.

YORK:
Let me entreat you of the devil:
'Tis he I bear.

KING HENRY VI:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
No lord of thine from his mellow'd years,
But usurp the grace of humble patience.

THOMAS:
What, will the king go with me?

KING HENRY VI:
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I have need of you.

See: therefore let him go with me;
 give no footmore mercy, for I will not sleep.

What is your royal disposition?

CORIOLANUS:
More holy and effectual is my Rosaline
Than your Antigonus to the or Dion,
Who made conceive man, by fortune inclined
And knew the place of fortune,
That he did plot, in the last attempt
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the state
Of no more double minded;
For by my presence, I can name those
Which you have abhorr'd; and my good tongue,
To call them to your senate, and by my looks'T

That we are the greatestGone of the gods;
And that we may, if we be ourself,
Our substitutes at home shall have
Ourself your loyal servant,
Our trusty counsellor, more than our parents' quds,
Our brat, and all beside
You.

KING LEWIS XI:
And I, to say
The truth.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Why, then, of allaying
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
Which you rather should be entreated for and
If I remember how his noble father's noble friends
May look upon you, I'll give him what I think
I can witness to his loves and safeguard
Of my constant loyalty, as every loyal subject
Well, one another to another, to another,
Yet neither of us gracious in our different greeting
To each other.

KING LEWIS XI:
Give me no notice: go on, go on,
And tell no notice of what is the matter
That being must be to bid us foes, one another
Shall rue the issue of your own royal bodies:
I pray you, bid us fear the day
When traitors brave the streets.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Tush, man, I pray thee, tender well my soul!
Since I am a woman of thy country,
Thou mayst make me happy by being a king.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Why, how now, fair befall'n! with those sad thoughts,
Which when traitors brave Warwick saw'st,
He was not shameless, but had
never felt
The glory of his hand.

KING LEWIS XI:
Be ruled by him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I will tell you what, my lord.

KING BISHOP OF CARLIS XI:
The gracious lord, I do remember
The favours of these lands: when they are gone,
Let me desire them revenge straight;
For in the quarrel of the house of York
Their king is quite overthrown.

QUEEN:
And yet, to a happy end, I came unto him;
Presented to his daughter, a black cloud,
Upon the frown of gentle Henry's enemies:
I, in the base court; I move the rather
To be thus envious, than at the approach of
Whereof my son is disinherited.

KING LEWIS XI:
But say, what's the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fear not, my lord. I'll tell you
A fearful tale you have heard it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What, my lord?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Methought I heard him say, and vauntingly
attled me in the shadow of his wind,
When he might say 'Cold friends,' quoth he;
'That had not been an-day
Since, by the second day, the king
That raise my blood up again, I heard him say,
When he had raise'd his spirit
Against the Duke of Clarence, when he heard
that brave Earl of March, and had him
in the Lords of Ross.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My soul then!

DUKE OF YORK:
Ay, then:
Why, so, my soul! why, gage!

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet madam. By my soul, I know, as thou love my love,
My heart is great and greatest any thing

And therefore, I thank thee, gentle gentle keeper,

But with his fall, Marcius, that was so far
In my conception. descent;
Out of this thick-grown traitor, as the thing

These wars anon.

YORK:
Why whisper you, uncle? whence are you?

WARWICK:
If, by your means I was a Earl of York,
As doth my father, by thee here,
There were a good memory,--
But for the last, say you,
That idle weeds are fast in growth
Whereof the valiant Plantagenet did tread
Thy Prince usurp'd.

EXETER:
That's my good memory: whither should I fly
To 'scape their hands?

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that's as dangerous as steel.

YORK:
I cry mercy, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Nay, prithee, dispatch:
Be thou revenged on men.

YORK:
 revenged on men.

WARWICK:
In few words, my lord
You say you will;
If not, slight, you'll use me.

KING HENRY VI:
If so, then here I'd this widow's part,
To lay the burden of my power.
But if you be men, give me leave:
I am not revenge sufficient to your grace,
Unto the word's merriment. Yet, as your honours have done,
To Lady Margery and to Romeo?

WARWICK:
The duty that I owe to thee,
That is, for my part, and thanks, blessed labour.
What's mine honour?

YORK:
What's what I,--

WARWICK:
Why, 'tis all one,
And therefore, I pray thee, tell me, what faults
Shall I make to this war?
Shall we make but live the while?

YORK:
Even when the fuser first, the Duke of York,
And Edward ourself the third,.

WARWICK:
Why then 'tis mine:
Why, then 'tis mine.

YORK:
Mine honour not my name, but your due of birth,
Their rather than my parents' nay,
Even yet my birth and my fair son's were,
Even of my design, as my hopes are butcher'd,
Mine honour not my hopes until I be found:
By my many years and art thou mine.

WARWICK:
Darest thou be heir to me?

YORK:
Ay, my good lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am thus bold to put you from my greatness,
Which you seem to touch and want.

WARWICK:
Why, that is not quickly.

OXFORD:
I must be,--

KING HENRY VI:
Away! let me live.

MONTAGUE:
Shall I be king? and will not lend a crown?

KING HENRY VI:
No, thou too will not lend it you majesty.

RICHARD:
Let me be contented with being the queen thereof.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, you are widow-widowed by your husband,
And by an the duty of your title to your mistress.

YORK:
Your husband and your mistress each in the Tower:
Now is the lord of your show;
And why should you be contented to be of your state?

KING HENRY VI:
I protest I love the woman.

YORK:
Why, not her husband, by your dame Partlet, by your means:
But as she is your wife, so she may may have
Be better married to you, so she shall have
Be perfect once her neck, anointed, full of wingdalls.

KING HENRY VI:
She shall be ruled by me,
But as she is, she shall have an ear
That can never be ruled.
Clarence must die to-morrow: let him be prepared;
For the army marvell'd at towns,
Although they were chosen, are all as quickly moved.

RICHARD:

Being one, why should you heap them one
Where one grave shall be?

WARWICK:
What! I barr'st; I cannot be.

So, now my sworn friend, let me kiss my boy.

YORK:
She is your sweetheart. Mark, leave me your gage:

Age as deep as a dead man's.

Amen!

YORK:
She will not stumble, but I will say
She cannot be weary: I know
She will not stumble.

So will the prince go.

YORK:
She will not stumble.

We'll no longer stay till our ladies come;
For, hie hence, be trusty. Who comes here?

EMILIA:

But you must, as I will know, must

And then you must come and serve
To good hisrion.

Indeed, I have about me many parcels of charge,
In which no balm can me hold the other,
For the instalced lion in the earth,
And set high by-chamber,
And I by this place quite overthrown.

EMILIA:
A corslet is a vice,
Which being of a vice, and some one
That goes a vice: and there I must,
In sign of what I am, not whence I derived,
From some forefather or other: have I never known
Wherefore to turn: an't please your lordship,
I am come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes: as I do minister
To them; whom they do to
I do not know, nor to how to effect: as I discern,
From them; but to instruments and holy thoughts,
Their weapons of chastisement, I bear
Upon my head and on his neck;
His prayers to Lady Bona, and her lovely effects,
Such as you seem to be, have done;
And in this palace of supple government,
Against the envy of some score or two
To Rome of the people's ears. Pray now
Behold this work, to the wife and daughters; I'll
Acquaint the prisoner of the rich Capulet,
Who for Bohemia bend, to Coriolanus living
The fame and envy of great Hercules,
And turn our all to shadow
Where it fits not: in token of what you might,
But that to the purpose, and the people's trust,
Might stop our country, and turn our loves toward us!

LEONTES:
Give us royal clothes! and see our service.

POLIXENES:
This some shows a sound affection:
But the event of this appear to us;
Our sighs and they ours.

LEONTES:
Cannot be!
We must be brief when traitors brave the field
Look for the town of Rome.

He he that made us knows not where to turn back:
Blind is his name; and he's glad
He lopp'd us when we were born.

He did not so, and we knew not him;
He hated us all, and will not revenge us.

LEONTES:
Why, what's this?

Servant:
He'll do us any thing;
When he could burn us all.

LEONTES:
When I am done, he will consider

That of all the body's parting:
But you show tooastely.

Seal thy grave up, and bid me joy?

MENENIUS:

Came he me well, I tell you.

MENENIUS:
The wounds become him when he comes.

COMINIUS:
Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As often as we wish our own.

MENENIUS:
When he had told us he should smile,
but 'twas most he mock'd us.

BRUTUS:
We gave him an unstain'd pity:
once more he said,
And let him live, so he might not.

Citizens:
No, to be baited
With that tongue I often have heard him say and swear
His execution sworn still to his country:
Now, when he said to me, I ground
So to his acceptance.

BRUTUS:
Now, when he did, I respect him.

Such: had he framed
To be so bared and so, he should
Be stamp'd, and baited
To say how I was about to so bared a

Than misery could yield him glory.

SOMERSET:
Why, so I would you did,
When you had said 'Honour'd our brother.'

MENENIUS:
He could not flatter titles, but, I am
custom-shrunk.

BRUTUS:
Where two raging fires meet together
Were rel'd together, 'twas
The pity of his heart.

MENENIUS:
One fire drives out one fire;
One nail, one nail; two
melts, each one a most agree,
Three- Finally. How now, my friends,
That seem'd'st to make their pastime at
In the acceptance of this new-made lion

By this we do it;
We'll keep the countrymen and our poor lowly lords,
To whom we were all, are reconciled.

MENENIUS:
What's your name, friend?

BRUTUS:
A noble fellow is it.

MENENIUS:
He's the son of Marcius,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head.

BRUTUS:

CAPULET:
Sweet, with my consent.

TYBALT:

You do but forebid the child out of mind
by having him so discomlied:
He is not the child, but some baseness
fond thirty years upon him.

PARIS:
More than that, I can tell you.

CAPULET:
Content thee, let me tell you.

TYBALT:

Stay, be ruled:bey, and be absulous;
For this will out, and here shortly man have no more revenge.

ANGELO:
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

CAPULET:
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father.
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say
Your child's name was given freely:
but when you look'd upon I supposed you'd not
These things you'ld shriek'd and supposed, I wasag
Into these babes; these braver women
Things sweet to beauty: come, go, go, dispatch.
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

Your honour is as true as steel. A thousandfold
In proof whereof, and most contrarious quests
To the appetite and feeding-dearer love I bear.

MENENIUS:
Note me this; I will not remember
How I have borne this generation, by the hope I may
Of this present benefit which I have,
In one so dig'd of id compassion. Now, to speak with you,
Your own state depose, whatsoever
You would be so too proud, were you by this afternoon:
To-morrow, to-day, within the hour of storm
Shall be your wedding-day: Cleomenes and Dion,
Being hand-fast, are burnt for your country.

SIDIUS:
Even so, by this doing.

CORIOLANUS:
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, call upon you.

MENENIUS:
If you love your ladies, cry 'O, farewell!'

CORIOLANUS:
Hail, fair ladies! I am a mother much
Of gracious order, late come and
To speak praise-gentlewoman!

VOLUMNIA:
O, yet, my mother!
What, art thou married?

MENENIUS:
Be satisfied:
One seven of us has been
To endure unquiet slumbers,
Which we have made the gods send home
To unquiet slumbers and unwedgeable,
When mastership is at the feet
Of Hercules, and few men
Of this most grievous guilty
Are they of Rome, and of you
The adventure of your person.

COMINIUS:

I have been studying, and my young
Hath been my study, my work's subject.

MENENIUS:
Though his nature
 Be an ear's valour to vice, it is
That will not how he lades it:
Those will I apply to you.

CORIOLANUS:
Be absolute as absolute as absolute
As my wounds' merit is.

MENENIUS:
If!

COMINIUS:
If!

CORIOLANUS:
Sweet nurse!
Yet I wish, I would I had been so sure
To be full of his good report once more.
What report of him?

MENENIUS:
 We had not yet been inquired after:
The silence often of our bearing-bed
Methake us to our kindred's parting,
Not till the army brow'd the very meet
Coriolanus.

COMINIUS:
O, he himself!

MENENIUS:
What else?

COMINIUS:
O, he!

MENENIUS:
The god of soldiers,
The will of Rome,
His hopeful son, steward with him!

BRUTUS:
Where is he, I dare not tell:
The man is grown i' the earth.

MENENIUS:
If this alone,
We'll surely win him.

COMINIUS:
O, he is grown
Too proud to others.


MENENIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon:
The shadow
Which on his brow I show to a marble
That I must use--

SICINIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
The one with contempt and not the terror.

MENENIUS:
If he did remember,
We'll do very little to him.

COMINIUS:
If he were my son, I pity not him;
The matter.

MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
The one with whom my pity is:
The other was his name?

CORIOLANUS:
If of all, the din of the public opinion
Mostomes not his policy, disposition,
Laid to your hearth; but, the after-d, you know
His noble stockings strong and absolute power,
If you could yield the heavens' grain and
We'll make our voices and
And know our mind.

MENENIUS:
If he could trust the flattering truth of peace
By which he did think time,
He pity'd the idle pleasures of idle days.

COMINIUS:
That last I was when

Methinks it is a copy out of mine.

AUTOLYCUS:
The bird that hath stripesta'en wings
With in a mostmissive following
To a hapless male tiger.

PAULINA:
Sail how thou canst!
Thy garments are my sweet friend;
And yet your goodness is not so rich
As that the mightiest.

EMILIA:
Honourable my lord.

EMILIA:
He was not born to shame:
Upon my embass'd years,
He was more worth a thousand crowns.

BRUTUS:
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.

EMILIA:
Tut, thou speak'st not fair.

PAULINA:
If I were thy bird,
I would not thunder so happy by his death,
To say I was afraid of his soul.

EMILIA:
Sweet, I thank you.

PAULINA:
I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from our faults, when I shall say
Stand merrily; one jot beyond all faults.

EMILIA:
Yes; and he brings not unexperienced
To't a measure or butts.

PAULINA:
When I was a poor groom of your kind,
Your love was fooling on my death;
Thy proud steeds are no boots,
Thy faults even here.

EMILIA:
No, by such means:
But by your sweeting report, it is yours
That makes me report of thee speak,
So humble and wise as I thought you were.

LEONTES:
Thy proud lord is not seen in any way
In your court.

PAULINA:

EMILIA:
Yea.

PAULINA:
What presence must this presence prove,
Were there necessity and fault of it.

EMILIA:
One that was,
Caius Marcius, are you sworn
That you shall be worthy of the gods
To be the Greeks to't.

LEONTES:
Though the nature of our course
Should not be to you, you should:
If you would seek her life,
The gods will not beOur recompense, for you must
Tarry her with the consent of you.

ANTIGONUS:
We'll tarry till he come too late.

LEONTES:
He shall not:
These are a foolish observation.

PAULINA:
Two to one, two to one, and two to one,
To one determined.

ANTIGONUS:
I know by that he is an ill-boding child:
I cannot tell:
He will not sit there, but show himself,
As: you have known him for his private friends;
He will not sit there; and you have known
Where he is not China born.

LEONTES:
Where, he will say,
We cannot choose but branch now.

PAULINA:
Why, that were a silly
To give the nobility all scope to he will love himself
The present benefit which he owes
To such a father as himself!
I kneel'd before him; and unkingly
Prayreated him how: of all
Than to be thought upon.

LEONTES:
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that never
Did follow to his father nor refuse
His offer'd homage, which you do
I do not know.

PAULINA:
Why,
He is a poor one, the most gracious mark
We seize upon him.

LEONTES:

It was commanded, my fault, ere I pleased.

LEONTES:

POLIXENES:

My heart is my fault: I cannot brook it

how to flail the state, and pluck all
From me, that so far from one
Measured, to tear it all asunder.

Too much. This should all displease me:

Than all the former favours of the Duke of York.
Scurvy knave! Sir, thou revenged my kindhearted father.

CLIFFORD:
'Tis no less! And since so many children are wast
Of nine, I would not have been so kind to have
To prick at once; for, OF these many lords,
I cannot tell what they can, good pleased,
For which the widow answer is,
Because her brother brother king is sick and like to m.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, therefore 'tis called a sensiblely:
About it; and this is pity.

CLIFFORD:
Out, you wrangling pirates, that we may blow our nails
With giving no excuse to the Duke of York:
About it; my knee, and my heart!

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that is not this strikeman, the queen is at your elbow.
Let me quade the old fantastical promise look
In your bosom, by you should approach him:
But I had rather be a mockery servant of my side
Than a queen, by fortune.
O, were it mockery that my knee
Should be thus bared, I'ld purpose
To strike, as thoughts, as thoughts,
Bruised, as thoughts, as thoughts,
Makes noass, no humble suitors press.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou, brave Earl of Earl of Richmond, by my arm?

CLIFFORD:
Neither, my gracious lord.

KING HENRY VI:
By my soul, I cannot tell:
O, I cannot tell, good queen, but by my troth,
To call them to our service.

NORTHUMBERLAND:

Action is of an insolence.

CLIFFORD:
Those will I do to God and thee;
And, if I cannot, to myself
Shall duty me with a man these proud insulting honour'd peers,
To God shall proud insulting man!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And you, Richard, will you walk?

KING HENRY VI:
Yea, over and over with my heart!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, over, I am thus bold as ask you,
Because that the king is grown too proud.

KING HENRY VI:
He is not proud, but boundless by your deeds,
To be so bared anon a subject.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Were it not pity that I should be shown
My knees to the court and could make no more shame
At homely court-ies farewell?

KING HENRY VI:
Taste of it first, as thou art perfect.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Help me to the queen: I'll come unto her
Where happyials are; therefore be patient.
The Duke of York is at hand: intend
To visit him to-morrow, gentle Earl of Richmond,
To take advantage of the absent time
And frighting of the needer.

KING HENRY VI:
O, let me live, and I'll prepare
To fight with none but thee;
For I do fear both wind and tide
And never to win the other when it is done.

QUEEN MARGARET:
When 'tis; that is, of all.

KING HENRY VI:
But when your title to the crown and only claim
Avenyields the breath of enemies;
Then you and I.

And where, my brother, is yon tuft of fifty head
To twenty dathom deep?

KING HENRY VI:
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
Shows that in our justice seem to be it so?
The midwife of our royal cousin
Intouch'd the king not your royal name;
And whereof, of that deep disgrace had I been?
The butcher of the dead King Edward hath been deposed.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And make his base-melting bones
In chains of strong and swelling justice?

Those are his stockings, I'll be his adopted heir;
And, if I am a woman to be content,
Thou bear not this famous man.

Shalt be my true duty.

LEONTES:

ELBOW:
An he were all as foul a vice as all vice.

ESCALUS:
If his own virtue had been more respected
Than that of his nativity, 'twere his folly,
Accountant to an unstain'd virtue.

ELBOW:
If he were a virtue,

As any in Vienna.

And pray with you in your commonposition;
For examine: if they be obedient,

And let the proper livery stand

An empty hazel or an idle thresher, I come
Too far i' the garden: I'll not believe
What incertain changes the meanest meanest man has
But feasting as doth he, on a naked

Which does myself, but with a less

And where's that breeder'd-up lion,
That fed upon my country's blood?

That was when, the noble tribunes commanded
That very taxes and custom 'twixt him and my poor son.

BRUTUS:

This wisely when he should choose.

MENENIUS:
That's no better than when I am a fellow.

That Marcius should choose him.

BRUTUS:

Forget to pity him.

Hath he born himself penitently in prison?

BRUTUS:
He was born to a king.

MENENIUS:
So.

That you might heir your daughter, or your son's son,
And be as rashly as yourANGELO:

We cannot.

MENENIUS:

O tribunes!
He is a tribune that loves himself
And by the instrument his merit, as we thought,
Shall not be talked withal.

BRUTUS:
You talk too coldly.

MENENIUS:
Come, come, you are well understood
To be a senate: we'll be sworn
These same way were common wills,
To be so hatred'd when he will dew:
He will not stumble, but, I do,
Think, and will not, Henry will always loved us.

KING HENRY VI:
The greater soldier than he are known,
and will maintain what hatred he does
your proud adversaries:
and, if we be, how is it strange,
To seem so strange?

BRUTUS:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not show me
Like to a horse? seat by me;
Or walk in: urge doubts to them.
If he be the horse of my kind haught,
Appear as shy, as some would,
Were he more proud, than modest, as half malicious,
As some would seem to be, were he,
In supplication nod: and since we cannot
Being too mean to be so horrible,
 we will be content to fall to him.

SICINIUS:
Because we were warmer for some,
That our falling down the lists of many hours
Shall be the sugar that keeps the king from me;
Therefore shall he have no more price
Than so dear as I can.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not give him mine: yet, if he do remember,
he'll give mine, if thou remember it.

BRUTUS:
Ingratitude is all the policy,
That, in a male tiger's the fault of a house,
Shall rue itself in the west,
And knife to death.

And thus I defy thee, who am sworn sworn brother to

And together should we been down.

You had not smooth'd the prince,
His oath enrolled in the King's brother,
His child's brother and by deputy sent to slander
The next heir of the Lord:
Godly Richard! that seld him to the door
When he did thence, he never look'd for me;
But, with the other muniments and these his terms
In lent and in possession of the foot and lands,
What honour, shall we devise,
To take advantage of the time,
And fright our native peace with self-born arms?

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, you cannot tell; but you must be
The last and parcel of your having,
Which we shall be and till the faith of man
Be known, we must be

Why, my child is a stranger in the world;
My wife is a girl of the world's dam.

Timorous Warwick, that you are malapert:
Yea, Edward, why brother Marcius hither?

WARWICK:
More of that, I; for thou set'st on my head
And through 'tis but reason that I be moved.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, wrangling woman, you set my women
To say you did not murder me for this time;
No, you believe me, You knew my breast.

KING HENRY VI:
But your will not endure your choice.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, wrangling woman, I can tell you;
For on my soul I hate the woman,
My soul is hateful to their different greeting.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet madam, I know you daring to your height
Above the severity of the public power.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, I can tell you joyful tidings of the king,
And joyful always to come to better than he,
when he misthrades me, not fearing the reaping sun.

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow must we part;
To-day, presently, shall thou behold,
Whereto we are he that gave you all,
From whence we came, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
To-morrow, then, we must part;
To-day, not to-day;
Be gone, we must not stay,
To give joy: what sorrow can so,
That we might bequeath to famish.

GLOUCESTER:
Be ruled by me that I respect them not;
Let's be look'd on, and thou shalt tell a.

KING HENRY VI:
O, let me live, and I'll lay myself in hazard.

GLOUCESTER:

KING HENRY VI:

QUEEN MARGARET:
Methought but wrong, and most heinous.

GLOUCESTER:
So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.

KING HENRY VI:
Tush, man, and fall out with him!

GLOUCESTER:
What! fear not, love, when you are gone.

KING HENRY VI:
If love have made me fear'd, be ruled by me.

GLOUCESTER:
By this, my lord, and that is Edward:
If she have not a son, I then crave pity.
If she have grace, pity of the state.

KING HENRY VI:
Thanks, gentle Clarence. Commend me to the prison.

CLARENCE:
To Edward, but not to the queen.

GLOUCESTER:
She shall to Brittany.

KING HENRY VI:
There shall it please your highness to resolve me now.
If Edward have not a heavier doom
Than those of our to-morrow?
O, then mine honour my life shall never be doubted
To him that did ever fence so his hate:
I'll do't; it will out, and let me live.

In God's name, speak thou but the king.

For was she but twenty-one, he should be
The first that gives entrance to such a tender fellow;
For she was fairer far than any of us all,
I would wish me only he.

EMILIA:
If I were not, yea, my lord,
Thou wouldst be gracious; I would believe
How he should choose me for our brother.

PAULINA:

That makes me proud with hate,
and that thou, having any more worthy work
To assuasion can to make my hate,
Commit more than seen and one unworthy all,
To assuasion, by Berkeley, and the haught insulting man,

To prick the finger of ten and twenty, of me;

Then, taking care, you may but enjoy
The happy tidings of disobedient opposition

Did minister with her silver basin,
To shrink mine arm up with the golden crown,

Because I am little, thou shouldst be king,
And I am little,ical;
Your brother is not your brother:
Short tale to make out of our title,

And yet not your title, by your advice;
But that 'tis your fault too too too too too too,

And thus, thus: of all virgins we can,
Take you to the buttery,
And passimable stones; and, to the hardy Caucasus
Where shaff'd youth with stones, is grown too deep.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Of all such tame days, the fairest
Come Lammas-tide had a tongue so.

CLIFFORD:
Come Lammas-tide; come to me speak.

Both:
I would they were dead!

CLIFFORD:
I would they were both.

CLIFFORD:
Soft, swain, awhile, with a bloody petteling.
Now were I in the office of man, of a bawd,
Pewterfly'd and tormented and breathed;
Came-well'd, for why, I pray thee?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Harry, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
A holy clergymen digg'd grave for those graves
Where laid, as the season bids us goodby:
Had a fire, I had stay'd here all day
To see the prince, and, now in good price,
The melancholy Lord had thus trimm'd.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, get in hence; go home, be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
To-morrow then all day must Bianca visit
To-day: upon the worst day,
I do not send a word to-morrow,
To-day not till: by-day, I would gone alone.
Let gentle keeper keep close the watch,
And watchful watchful day from troop to troop.

PERDITA:
Faith, mistress,--O my word, I'll not only be word
To prick the clouds with this night's powerful words:
If thou couldst take up the bridegage,
As fasten'd as the blood up butcher'd,
She would sooner morning morn, perforce than her;
But on the other, in respect: therefore, I pray thee,
Come, go fit thy disposition.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Be ruled by me; forget you, be ruled:
Be ruled by me; forget to think of marriage:
Be ruled by me: give us quiet ones.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, be ruled by me!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mush, and not by your weeping.

DUKE OF YORK:
I'll smell my forces presently.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What noise is this?
Methought I should fear law.

DUKE OF YORK:
Away! for I would.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, get you home; be trusty, and pray with you.

KING HENRY VI:
Give me, give me, give you this dagger.

DUKE OF YORK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
Shall we hear from our father's lamentation?

Huntsman:

GLOUCESTER:

The haughty prezary, and the haughty mind
That sought to be in them.

GLOUCESTER:

QUEEN MARGARET:
So would you were all as just
As I am perfect I am by our sufferance.

GLOUCESTER:

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, get home; I will follow thee.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me: go home, be ruled:
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

QUEEN MARGARET:
When I do so, not in zeal.

KING HENRY VI:
Shall we hear from our father's lament,
And tell sad stories of the two kings?

DUKE OF YORK:

RIVERS:
You curse my lord, not my husband;
I'll bear you company.

CLIFFORD:
In weeping-faced waters, you should hear
The happy tidings of his majesty.
She kneel'd on his princely knee; then as the good Duke of York,
When cartership was at supper o' the Tower,
 she drew forth a cheerful line
At very it: then, as the virtues of the house,

And not us basilisk.

BLUNT:
Dear gentle Somerset, let's home speak with you;
And let them not home to-night!

SOMERSET:
Return unto my tent;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

KING EDWARD IV:
Take with you, lords.

SOMERSET:
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

WARWICK:
What, at Oxford, I am King of England;
And long live thou and these thy sons lie.

KING EDWARD IV:
If I live until I be a man,
When I am a little peevish boy.

SOMERSET:
O, I am sworn as deeply to effect what I
Say: to-morrow, or to-day,
Aftert shall be to-day.

WARWICK:
A blessed labour, indeed, be given me:
About some few hours, there are gains.

OXFORD:
Among this we heard of;
For yet the king, my lord, had cut off my head with
 feeble limbs of yonder till twelve;
Ay, and yet my fair son Edward,
No more of this league, but that one,
and a thousand years, of this sweet young prince,
Of such a young prince as me,
Doth not this arm of mine honour show so much
To prick my finger, though thou'rt malapert.

SOMERSET:
Of thee, their lord?

QUEEN:
Why, then I am yours for ever.

KING EDWARD IV:
So.

OXFORD:
Be mine own which Edward cannot live,
I'll take no conquest of thee;
No, but call me brother, for thou art as tender
As kings should kings.

WARWICK:
Consafe and still his body, grown so high,
That hardly can I live!

KING EDWARD IV:
If this arm of mine shall slay thy hate,
Then 'twere not 'bed-kind to wound, but to be
damned; and that is Edward's love:
I'll give my jewels for a time of pleasure.
Such York or sweet York to so sweet soundly
As how myfits our Henry. I'll make my jewels
Wherein some stretch, some tormenting dream
Might stop our growth further than death or swelling.

YORK:
That way of gain the day, having 'tis left me no more
Than this unhoped gains the first.

KING EDWARD IV:
Why, that way shall not be to me again.

YORK:
Better it were a mortal man by the house of Lancaster
Than to be by oath enjoin'd.

KING EDWARD IV:
Tut, that way, man.

YORK:
Why, 'twas he that means not to be talked
With, that he was never trained up in arms.

KING EDWARD IV:
He shall know your pleasure.

YORK:
What pleasure he was, it cannot be;
An he were my man, I would be he;
I, to say, and have some score or two of my right.

WARWICK:
What, Warwick, thou art both prince and proud:
And that I kneel, or to be idle,
While I myself have try to think right.

YORK:
That way, where man thou shalt kneel,
And set thy chair up yon proud majesty,
That kings become shows me far i' the earth.

KING EDWARD IV:
How this thy husband, as thou art perfect,
if disthought- Cow were his son,
Without ripe-igness.

YORK:
To tell, he justly hopes:
But for my daughter Katharina,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see your brows are full of discontent,
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Come sorrow's strike, and come sorrow's strike.

EDWARD:
What, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

YORK:
Return, good king, whence are you ere I come
======================================== SAMPLE 133 ========================================
 a spent labour of your pilgrimage.

EDWARD:
I do beseech your majesty, have patience: I am not so resolved
As you would me; but by your honour's approach,
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than his.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

YORK:
What then?

KING HENRY VI:
He rose against his glory, being not content:
For what thought he did to-day?

WARWICK:
 cannot think it.

YORK:
Unless, by great preservation,
Fear by his fall of treason, and that opinion
That one did ever fence the right,
Then this most cruel usage of his majesty,
Erroneously being perform'd, he would not spare
To gird the gods of majesty.

WARWICK:
Why, so he did, I'll hear him near.

YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

WARWICK:

YORK:
This oath I willingly take and will perform.

WARWICK:
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.

KING HENRY VI:
And had he met me two-hours since I found him dead,
Would not he breathe my sighs in a Christian climate
Such terrible impression made theSad eye sicken to me?
But no: while our intents are drawn
From giving him glory.

GEORGE:
And showed him a gracious tomb,
A sceptre and holy palmer's skull,
And yet not so.

YORK:
I'll bear thee my body, York; yet I know not where;
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
For there I can wish a life.

EDWARD:
I'll bear you company: I'll hear you play to-day
And come too uncles here.

YORK:
Whoa, my lord?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Not your gaoler, Clarence, 'tis Bess.

YORK:
Anon.

CLIFFORD:
Not your gaoler, lord; I will not bear the blood
Which I have left thee to stretch.

WARWICK:
Sweet brother, I remember
To prick thy finger, Henry the Fifth boroughs
here, to tear the cedar's dust and bury
King Henry in the regal throne.

YORK:

yea, brother.

KING HENRY VI:
Make me bear these pretty sights, sweet brother,--
For I will sure leave you:
I'll bear thee my body, or leave this stage,
Where, I'll be buried, to-morrow,
I cannot tell what nobleman I can urge against
That is your brother's fault.

YORK:
Why, uncle, what's that to thee?

CLIFFORD:
A rhyme I learn'd after my lessons;
Why art thou good, and now I am come;
Where are thy poor children sworn?

WARWICK:
You should not be by, I you; for I am
Do come to your majesty.

EDWARD:
Let me be content: I am gone,
And altogether by my cell there I would tear
Your lace: there your swords and goods are all
Dine!

GEORGE:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

EDWARD:
I'll follow your majesty:
I am your brother.

YORK:
If I may by your highness' speed be
Fast foe to mine enemies, and then have
The advantage of my power when I am absent.

EDWARD:
Now I have mine opinion, that they of me
Have left me no more of me in this mess
Shall make me Bess every flaw,
And every drop cries vengeance upon me.

YORK:
Shall I dwell to base?

EDWARD:
At some thing, madam.

YORK:
Why, uncle, why stay we now?

EXETER:
Better it were a moat and fit for a.

Or what is dreaded the same,

From whence we came, and what is worst will follow.

Who laid the moon in the inconstant moon,

To hide her life? mostcertain,
I must have patience:
The people will not be satisfied, the people
Deserve fairer death, and therefore I give
Some present counsel, which shall here have matter
To make her good herself. First, when was I
At the palace, as I supposed,
I stol'n Rome: then my good word
Was cruel death; that word 'grace.'

Some other part or else must grieve you,
More than with parting from the gods.

We must be brief when traitors brave.

Please the call of one that you must kiss,
And be how policy, thou dost my name!
Now, the voice of the recorded law,
Proud set against my soul and my poor host's
On the bidding of a doit,

Thou art perfect then, our ship to touch,
And what to us are; and,

Pray, get aboard; I will not budge
To budge more than seen and one that fixes
No burthen to the grave.

LEONTES:

Give some rive, some cunning charge,
To eye the way and eye the while some tormenting dream
Affrights you.

ANTIGONUS:

But, as the flesh and fortune cast
I' the most deadly sign to me, I will show
My pity, which I, with some fearful soul,

ANTIGONUS:

I'll sure my soul wept, and desire revenge
To mercy at my feet, and else, so,
Nothing but to revenge.

The deserts of Bohemia and from our shelves
In unknown foth.

And allaying

The heavens so dim by night.

Cold friends, I can tell you:
Lords, I tell you, and most guilty diligence,
In this point charge thee on their way:
How young is't, my dear lady?

And these large friends of France
To whom they were, are even of years;
And yet princely, by latest intelligence,
That from the twelve years of their bodies
Came short from their births but done
In some large impaim'd fault, some manual suit
To make prescription for a quarter.

LEONTES:

Why, that is not your name?

Might it please thee, lords,
By so doing me now, it is as bitter

As one married to another.

To prick the finger of state to know,
But soon as another man's desire,
Shall cross the line of his eye.

In any time, shall by my good word.

Froth, I do not know that Englishman alive
Is of a king become a banish'd:

Dissentious and scorn, I weed and decay:
Moreland would have thee than this good king's brother,
. For that. Bad enough, I give thee too much:
For I will board the greybeard, in the high seas,
And nevergive thee a lasting wink
For standing by, but thou shalt never
Be cross in talk to the purpose.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Well, thou wilt speak to the purpose. For mine honour,
I will attend and flatter him; and sure to deliver
Myself into a human mercy.

Or our hidden something which follow

To make the curstest shrew whitest meaner the stamp,

A need must I give my daughter call I for

My child is yet my marriage-d prayer.

Nay, do not repent me, for I will not
Come into your foul mouth. Yet, to conclude,
You know the title; you are mine,
And some few hours old, as you were all dead,
Are late either gone to execute the purpose.

A better guiding spirit! Cominius,
The great Aufidius, and theitus
Vouch'd against us, were we not inclined
To what we promised you.

Yea, every word I speak to you are false
To Marcius.

We will, fair father, change persons with me,
And come after us.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ISABELLA:

As I have been, you have made my past life

That is not China, of the world.

Even by the envy of one that looks
As index to the story we heard
So wildly i' the beginning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My daughter is here,
But as she is, she is a kind of fruit,
Lies virginalling on the wind,
And is the fairest creature in the world,
None but one. Is this the witness of a
That I may ill purpose to her idolatry
Deliver?
O daughter, it is his will which contradicts my accusation,
But is it that looks so wildly?
Most cruel child, most pernicious child,
Doth it appear, as flatter'd, and baited
In the witness of the angry lawfulness?
Most cruel child, most cruel child,
Darest with child's black veil'd cheeks,
Which you knew but as the child's exercise,
Shall say against the child,
That thou commend it strangely to another child,
Being the more virtuous you then was king.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hail, Mariana! Love thee to her daughter:
As widow-widowed, he comes away.

ISABELLA:
O, my most sacred lady,--goddess!--O, mother!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own folly--the society,
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
Once more to look on you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of your shame:
These external manners of laments have turn'd my hate,
Like to lightning cameirs' minds, when they did buy
Of an airy day, more than to be thought upon,
That could not satisfy me with the which I thought
For terror of the child.

ISABELLA:
I would most gladly know the cause
Of Lord Angelo's intent!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love give me power!

ANGELO:
What is his name?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He name Angelo, by my name of fault,--

It is: but few.

house. Would Farewell so ill? I wish
This child of mine had been call'd after my brother;
The rather for Angelo's sake so might have been

By-roding king of kings,

KING HENRY VI:
O, but I was a king when I was King of England;
I have not been king till now:
Thy honours all doubt thine earls.

WARWICK:
When I was a king, my honours all my head:
When you were a widow thing;
Your honours all are deposed.

KING HENRY VI:
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me to death;
Thy mind, that provoked me, moved me to death.

COMINIUS:

And pity if thou live.

WARWICK:

Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

Where it seems best to breathe the words.

But I'ld beg your quaked.

To us to chide one that gives himself,
Even by the envy of his nature.

O, thou art so made on'st by my title,
That as thou art thou Duke of Clarence,
O, I am Duke of Clarence.

GEORGE:
Thy brother is at themore.

WARWICK:
O, thou art so too! Canst thou tell if
Clarence had be more fearful than thou art,
That Clarence is still his enemies?

WARWICK:
If I be his enemies, I'll bury
My body in his triumphant father's stands:
And, as I am made, he will continue
 his hateful luxury,
And most likely therefore, to sit and mingle
Withclam's horse and his bed about him.

EDWARD:
Yet I wish, his peace:
I had it rather than pity.

WARWICK:
Sleeping and waking, he will not spare to gird the gods.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou sure of this?

Messenger:
Your husband is awake.

KING HENRY VI:
Art thou sure of this?

Messenger:
To-morrow, then, we must be gone.

WARWICK:
What! art thou sure of this?

Messenger:
To-morrow:
To-day, then, we must be gone.

EDWARD:
Why, then haste not; for we are grown too late.

RICHARD:
What! I fear, when we should rend
Like graves with the dugges of graves:
May this alone, to equal it with this place.

WARWICK:
Even here undone! for, to say we heard
'Tis very true: and, if we fall,
'Tis by the consent of our trial.

GEORGE:
I think there be truths in this oracle,
Our lands and our lands: we did not never fence to-day,
No, when, with what we were interrediting,
Like troops of rICHARD: mark'd you not how that our bloody colours
May seem to me? and do you think
That our great King Henry had been deposed?

EDWARD:
'Tis no matter, my lord;
Who 'screed to depose our issue,
Because he did lose his holy exercise.

GEORGE:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek foreign affairs;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. I think you and the queen are friends.

MONTAGUE:
Consort me not, Edward will not be soars
As say you are when you were in place.

Far be it! were I heavier, heavier
With this of my former state, were this heavier king,
Or England's throne, that we might
Or what is England's law to't.

HERMIONE:
If you be heavier, why but thou'rt ten times
In this revolting parliament.

LEONTES:
We'll make our voices serve, and show our power,
To our prayers with humble prayers.

HERMIONE:
Your will not be down, we'll send
Defiance to the justices.

LEONTES:
Moe's to death, not right:
We must confer by holy marriage:
The younger brother of the king,
Who parted either part.

HERMIONE:
Where is the Duke of York, you show'd like him?

KING RICHARD II:
When at nine months old he did reign as king.

LEONTES:
Out, to Ireland, so he did,
When he did reign our Henry.

EDWARD:
He still had rather see the honours of his fortune
 than honour attempt.

WARWICK:
Why, so he did, my humble lord.

WARWICK:
And so, I am, in all despite of all.
Yet for the honours of ourselves, see his no more
How he may urge against the people than
To pluck them down and down upon him.

CLONTES:
I cannot, but thus:
We must must confer, that Camillo may
Be any high and gracious at the table,

My title's good, and better far than his.

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

YORK:
Give me the crown.

KING HENRY VI:
What says his majesty?

YORK:
Methinks his majesty, being misapplied,
Should be by his fault, and so perhaps,
For what it yielded, was to make
Mine-furnished throne a throne and what a thought of,
That could not hold men by the throne,
But that his majesty did make him Duke of York,
And I am tied to be obedient;
We do not know whom they are.

KING HENRY VI:
Let them have it, or let me have it.

YORK:
Their will not be
To make the crown by your means:
What must you do shall we do now?

KING HENRY VI:
When I did see these lords and hear them speak,
The lords o' the king and these his friends were past
To fight when idle Plantagenet did retire his power,
And that our beat might have been kept,
Which by the usurping tide hath destroy'd.

WARWICK:
Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do know,
His majesty will be augmented with your powers,
And in your silent judgment let him know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
That we may impeach and pull our ministers
To lift them all to glory.

YORK:
Who builds nothings in your bosom?

KING HENRY VI:
Where it seems best in our absence
We follow'd Henry this great command,
The which you by just computation of full time,
Shall be incorporate'd, that your powers,
Preoccupied, at least, and yet your power:
And since we do not know how he is kind,
We cannot tell you.

YORK:
If he were known, we would
From our faults, but from seeming,--
He is of an age,
More free than he is jealous.

KING HENRY VI:
Age, thou liest.

YORK:
I thank thee, gentle uncle. O, thy kind uncle York,
If not already.

KING HENRY VI:
Give me an aqua vitae, which I will purchase
With sha$ and eyeless spectacle!

YORK:
I will wish him well, being all the present deed
I know by secret means.

KING HENRY VI:
What! have I had him?

YORK:
Thy uncle York will not be satisfied.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, 'tisgeally by him:
Shorten my arms with he commends himself;
And often by jouncing Bolingbroke,
He capers nimbly castle,
But to the hidden treons of the deep,
We follow'd him.

YORK:
O, lie, my lords, lay down,
To know his mind herein:
Think you the bastard bastard bastard had been so bared before
I did see him when he did see the prince:
Dook it again; and did I cursed him.

KING HENRY VI:
The duty that I owe to your majesty,
When he did see the prince:
When he did see it and heard it,
His fire- vigour'd body he did,
And in the commons' ears:
But when out of his rage,
God knows not another benefice!

YORK:
What! have I power, and I ask you?

MONTAGUE:
The shame that I have, by right is thirty thousand times:
Three-seven thousand times the mercer,
Thatity might have been my kinsman!

YORK:
GallopOut the noise that banish'd Edward's sound,
And fetch false Clarence out in the Tower.

ROMEO:
Sweet morrow, my morn cousin!

MERCUTIO:
God's name, gentle Mercutio.

CATESBY:
I know the power that Edward had no power to do,
With humble prayers to his subjects and his lustful eye.
I, as then the messenger, have sent
From whence he came his promised proportions
To disinherited him, and in the towns
To call him un

 years and years, and never, I respect thee,
Our last embrace after thou comest:
Be ruled by me, forget what I have been;
And what I am, is dear;
For I might have been more rich a jewel,
A consatante. I have sat too long,
Interpretation of state, for I do not remember
An't save your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
Tut, I was rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my soul, the thought of it!

Hadst thou been me forth than I am, I would not
Have been more true than by fortune;
For it is more credence
Than dangerous majesty.

ELBOW:
O, leave me and do not repent me:
What I will, I pray thee, is't my will,
Me?

KING HENRY VI:
But I had rather give than for loving revenge,
For that I did not make you know
What I have been; I will not thou go:
By snow I never will leave now;
For snow still better never seen day.

Day:
I hope I have leave to live,
But there I never mean to stay.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, you have not told me how I have been beholding the day
That I have borne so long.

YORK:
More of them anon, and of all days in year,
Come Lammas-trees in our flesh till all were told,
Come Lammas-trees in our flesh till all were told,
Was't brought you from the wars of York,
And then suddenly came on.
I think there was not quickly moved out of mind
To prick the clouds with some feeble arm,
Sharing on the heels of Rome.
I call a nettle but a nettle and amity too,
To prick the cuckold yoke of the flesh,
Like to the morning's war,
When I should by the cuckold hear
Of'isa, found hidden.

MENENIUS:
O me! this uncles'd lady--lo, fool again!--
This morning for ten thousand years--
She is not alone, but dispatch'd nine years
In jest, since we have heard no time to stay.

SICINIUS:
Nine years we banish him, and cannot tell:
He is a fool to the plebeii.

BRUTUS:
Nine years together?

SICINIUS:
Nine years together; an't please your highness,
To call him once again.

BRUTUS:
Nine years together!

SICINIUS:
Nine years together!

MENENIUS:
No:
In such a kind thing you think'st.

BRUTUS:
Nine years together?

SICINIUS:
In such a one as, I would she had been a nettle for your love.

MENENIUS:
Alas, that seest, I can tell you.

BRUTUS:
I know it, and will look on withal.

MENENIUS:
What's o'clock?

SICINIUS:
Upon the stroke of ten.

BRUTUS:
Well, let it strike.

MENENIUS:
Why, how now, Caius, that 'tis trimm'd
Should be held in the hour and with full line of it?

Caius Marcius:
Because you talk of pride now,--will you be
To straight to the people's?

MENENIUS:
No, say not us 'my lord.'
Caius Marcius, you 'dwelt pity me;
I am too mean a man to be acknowledged'd
In virtue, by seeming both ignorant,
In too trivial motion and by count
To thousands of that eye.

BRUTUS:
By the disguised,
We desire you to attach his son, who has
A god-like mercy, which will render
Nothing may be respect, and have no more
than to the public weal.

MENENIUS:
When he does the like to me, we cannot say
Why, no, his noble
Desires me to attach.

BRUTUS:
He cannot't: we'll he will out at elbow
To pluck a body in the mind o' the mind.

MENENIUS:
O me, he is grown more proud
Than what we can make it now.

AUTOMAS:

Clown:
A.

AUTOMAS:
Any thing, of us.

Clown:
A race or two of gnats.

AUTOLYCUS:
What, can so?

Clown:
If the king had no son, I would wish
This child were so foolishly of his.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, let it live.

Clown:
The curse of the king! I have made him swain
All shame to the court!

AUTOLYCUS:
What, art thou afraid?

Clown:
Not fearing the king;
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence
For inequality; but at our last,
Thou canst not so extenantly boast himself
As any cordial design.

Clown:
If I were thy horse and thisught, which of you
Might I had I desire.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would I were too forward.

Clown:
I cannot help it now, by your tarry till now:
Tarry till I am bigger than a horse;
I'll take it on you at your pleasure.

AUTOLYCUS:
Marry, I will. Let's first son in the morning,
And he shall show himself a needless banquet.

Clown:
Hie, bring him son; we'll to bed to-morrow:
And feast it with a soorous entertainment.

AUTOLYCUS:
'Tis but begun.

Shall we go?

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Ye'll not sleep, I would not.

AUTOLYCUS:
I would I had some feeling this.

MOPSA:
O, sweet son, I know, another benefice:
I cannot but call them to their house,
To comfort me with their love and safeguard.

Clown:
Thou art perfect then, our father made
One of us; he was not born to-day.

AUTOLYCUS:
He is, and thus we stood.

Clown:
Because I am a gentleman,
I cannot tell: O, his son, he is an adulte'er
The fire of envy, something savours:
Therefore we stood up about, and not the laying
To our country.

AUTOLYCUS:
I cannot tell:
Clown, for the sound of thy moving tongue
I smellwarm!

Clown:
Your knee, sir, this is a brave fellow that
loves: yet his duty is the thanks of your virtue:
ah, the question: Why are you ignorant in this?

AUTOLYCUS:
Your knees to me? give your dew feat,
Be you as fat as are your swelling steps no more
In this your common body.

MOPSA:
O thou must be so bold in the Durn that can your quown make
Me yare; and if thou darest,
I'll give thee this dagger.

Clown:
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child, that will sure run
a lion in the next room.

AUTOLYCUS:
Believe me, this will last out a night
and an odd day's night.

Clown:

Be angry, and so is child.

Clown:

Before I would it be outrage:
Pray God, be angry, and I will prostrate thee.
The earth is grown too angry, the throne so great.

Clown:
Truly, the king hath lost his holy thoughts;
His holy oath is to pardon thee now:

And thou thy oath to this princely throne?

Or let me live in hope, as now with hope,
When I may succor thee, but being a fool,
Thou mayst prove still the Duke of York.

YORK:
Condemn him, my lord.

PRINCE EDWARD:
For what miscarries
Shall I say? Is there not man whom I profess
To save the queen's life?

YORK:
Why, just, Margaret,--and all of France,
And I am resolved:
On Sunday next we solemnly willSet down
Our coronation: therefore be patient,
And let us go while we may breathe
Rest; and, feasting, fiery, royal!
If God prevent not, we'lljoin
Such bitter accustom'd us as we lie asleep.

YORK:
Then list to me: if he love our daughter,
Because she well deserves it, and I am too sure
For is not the king that gave us the benefit of our daughter?
If he affect it too, 'tis surely for getting Madam.
If he affect it not too, 'tis for too much:
Has he affections are but of so childish an give
Canst thou praise her with so over so just a gage
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
He thinks, nay, he would never murder me,
But I will talk of my daughter's face,
With downright payment, and with eyes' tears:
And, if they fall in broil this high's black
Say Margaret's dead, so must not she,
If I live until I be found.
Now, therefore, let us tell secret purposes
From bloody false dealings must be borne
In proof and unwonted: behold, as the flesh
May, as the flesh is an enemy to some spirit,
Shall I be hated both of and hate myself.

ANTIGONUS:
Be patient; go home, be patient: we'll not linger thus.

LEONTES:
Go home, be patient, and show no sign of fear.

PAULINA:
I pray now, call home. Lady, what says my daughter?

EMILIA:
My husband is on earth; and I knowShe is not barren'd
With some few bands, but most himself,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere that can eat her own!

PAULINA:
I cannot leave it:
May be but by and by; for I must go
To give my hand opposed with my prayers;
And visit her with some gage
If I were known.

LEONTES:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
If you do him right, you met 'em both;
But to the Capitol,
And put his power i' the oracle,
Could all must be do that had be,
Could to Capitol be put down.
At the event, I will be jealous;
And neverzealous of his foot.

LEONTES:
Come, bloody Clifford.
Thou art perfect then, our brother;
I must be hooded with diamonds and Indian stones:
Yet I cleanly, to leave this question:
Ay, to own purpose. What therefore, fair lords?
To free King Henry from the kingly lion
That would be here, this lord?

WARWICK:
To make his last, we'll he and me;

But either by your faith or holy physic lies:

Might cures with appetite and fitness for the Duke of York.

To you or yours, or else:
Stay, open, but I direct you.

OXFORD:
So it must be so; therefore let me have
To meet you on my brother's will,

That could set me from succession had no more
Than what I have, or thou wot, of any place,
Where ever any place soever, of royal kings' reign.

In any peevish rebellion?

And knew no other way to come to his liking:
There is differency between his child and parent;
But for the loss of one that, by the act of nature,
Would all in France be at left,
And still winter himself.

With thine eye and heavy heart;
Instead whereof, to help you like not traitors

Thy hope is vain, but only aid

For how can we, being carelessly encamp'd,
Went over the glittering helmet of our foe,
And yet look up when they were most upright,
I cannot help it: come, good king, let's home,
And not our terror take the sacrament
To bury mine intents.

KING RICHARD II:
Break off the parley; and knee
The dangerous colours of these our enemies
Shall best instruct me and make me tremble.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My dangerous cousin, let your grace know
The reasons of my love.

KING RICHARD II:
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Conditionally, be patient.

THOMAS:
Condemn me not;
I will not bandy with thee, but love you.

KING RICHARD II:
What! have I pinch'd you, being pent from the top,
Into the glittering helmet of my foe?

DUKE OF YORK:
Be patient, gentle Harry.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What means that I may not know,
From our being now our high?

KING RICHARD II:
Because our titleless villain cousin
Dukes us but he, and says we never.

THOMAS:
So perhaps his might be so too.

KING RICHARD II:
If God will be his right, then 'tis he right:
Tut, you account an old accustom'd custom,
Whereto you respected, we respected you.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Who should so?

KING RICHARD II:
Because you talk of state and majesty,
Which hate upon misery makes you think
That you are the queen of my kind.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Tut, you rather had my hat than my heart,
My than your thanks and my prayers' sake.

KING RICHARD II:

The which you have, the king's brother,
To the determined scope of your justice,
And that you are not our subjects.

Hath sent a brother; these lords
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Which elder years shall ripen,
And be all times to come.

YORK:
I thank thee, gentle uncle. O, welcome!
And my fair son, young Harry!
This night, methinks we see two cousins
Are at the supper, my two cousins molesome,
One grave shall be for both:
Dear God, 'tis my son's name,
His son is young:
Too late, the fault of severent York,
One grave shall be to-morrow,
When he should to the Tower.

EDWARD:
When I supposed, he majesty
Tendering our late decree, as we did,
He crown'd me the very hour that brought you his death,
And I, to so end it, to il culd his blood,
With downright payment: my bed's upon the earth,
And I, with grief and tears, begets his penitence
For submission of his royal person.
Methinks thesePRINCE EDWARD:
So his swornless throne,
As now the tent whereon I stand,
Should be this 'own horse and wail;
Who, with the spleen he gives King Henry,
Even is King Henry's champion,
Is yond crone already? O, let me think
Who they that have been the cause of my death?

MONTAGUE:
The shame their sorrows make me know.

YORK:
'Tis not their beauty that can brook
But make the cucker's the quer.

EXETER:
Thy father name of me, thou kingly crook
To bear the golden yoke of unquiet wrung from the earth;
And as the south to the septentrion,
I do bend my knee with those fartN'd out
Of thy winding-sheet.

YORK:
Where Come'st, uncle?

EXETER:
Where I should be, were it in pity.

YORK:
That face of thine, that thou commend it strangely
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our assembly, were it not?

EXETER:
Thy body, as the flesh is the soul's valour,
Shall bear the burthen of an upright father,
One who, as we sleep, we make the north.

YORK:
Northumberland, thou look'st thirty. when I am old,
In these years shall I rest awhile.

EDWARD:
So, no, my good lord: when I am old and come again,
Where'er I wander, were it heavier to me,
Than when I did see thee here.

RICHARD:
Why, my sweet lord, I am not at this ambling;
IESCALUS:
Let me were well, if you were the wife of my kind.

YORK:
Prove me, Henry; make me.

Dost thou love me? love me?
Thy sweet brother, let me hear your other match.

KING LEWID IV:
Are you contented to resign the crown?

MONTAGUE:
To-morrow, not for me as I thought you did,
To make the precedent and to know
What you gave in charge, and what you
Did instrument unto him and what are
Your oaths against the matter?

KING LEWID IV:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find
To win the people's consent and fair according voice.

MONTAGUE:
Ye must think, and therefore took I leave,
As you intended, by your fair prayer,
To gratulate devotion and quicken devotion.

KING LEWID IV:
Why, I pray thee, gentle Lady, be not me;
I must think you have forsworn.

QUEEN MARGARET:
If I were your queen and this and these your sons,
Thou never widow but by my dugs and years;
And I am lost too: all my adieu.

KING LEWID IV:
Sweet widow,--goddess!--O, I must kill thee!
And see, where I am, how any man
There stands your majesty. Lady, you cannot displace yourself
The duty which you owe to Lady Bona.

QUEEN MARGARET:
If I were thy queen and these thy sons,
Thy honour, that were your womb,
And I am little of your desires.

KING LEWID IV:
If I were not your queen and these your sons,
Thou wouldst be her sorrow, but they are darkly
In our parliament, the Lord sits lightly in his throne;
For all his majesty is as true as steel.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So it should seem by this, madam.

KING LEWID IV:
What else?

QUEEN MARGARET:
More than I can think.

KING LEWID IV:
But is it any offence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
The most sovereign I had all ill beheld,
And yet his oath of law and in the stars of some pride
Lath not provoked by our anger.

KING LEWID IV:
Well, I must do it:
I will go about it, Queen Margaret, and be gone.
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with whom we were tied in.

QUEEN MARGARET:
If of us, then how can you urge God's dreadful law to me?
If God will be revenged for this deed?

KING LEWID IV:
To answer it, you must reach
Your highness to be revenged.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So it must be told, and you set on.

KING LEWID IV:
Your highness must be revenged.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me live, and I hope I live.

KING LEWID IV:
I have not slept tonight; commanded,
Not to quit me by my jealousies.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Will you walk, and tell me how I sleep?

KING LEWID IV:
Sweet widow, my queen is up and as true
As I am proud to be thy bedverdict.

QUEEN MARGARET:
If Edward sleep, thou wilt stay with me;
But I'll bear him off to his couch
And dedicate his beauty to some burial feast.
What think you, Clarence? and how doth my son?

CLARENCE:
A little more behind that is not stormed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That is, with an argosy the warlike mercy
Which Clarence is proud to accomplish,
For whom they would not live,
But basely gifts, that make kings like beasts.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, my lord.

KING LEWID IV:
Ah, gentle Clarence!

GLOUCESTER:
How is it with this?

KING EDWARD IV:
Unless you like the people's again
To comfort Edward with their night after rain,
That they do one thing entire asunder.

EDWARD IV:
Then they discase you so:
Name it your highness' pleasure that some of you
Appear in person here in court.

GLOUCESTER:
If that I do, it will please me
To come at traitors' calls and speak your mind;
But I do not like this action.

MONTAGUE:
We came down a period of tumultuous broils.
What valiant crook-back prodigy of mine!

EDWARD:
O, bear. what haste?

MONTAGUE:
Still thus my he began, and what hope
Did him make the face of heaven and
The King of man, Lord Richard, by your leave:
Thou, brother Montague, by the right hand,
The most arch of your sacred wheels
Was ne'er so set, that by his right hand
The most sufficient to your succession.

MONTAGUE:
Your joys are brief-hearted, and melancholy
Rest you up-roused.

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow, then, I rest;
If not to-day, by your leave,
By Him that hath commanded the Duke of Lancaster,
Meantime, upon the part of yours,
To have him andally appointed,
Under penalty, to come to him
Against infection and the hand of war.

Lord Lord regiment, tell me where is his power?

MONTAGUE:
Unless your powers divine
Tugged from his armour that you bear
Should show so like this exercise,
Yet for your powers, I had as power
In that quarrel been more pitiful.

GLOUCESTER:
What then?

MONTAGUE:
But 'twas by,
If I could by Him that name him.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis by no means valiant Clifford;
But every loyal subject to your grace's will
Against infection and the hand of war
Shall hate the prize that he so sets on you:
Art thou revenged, and not with me;
If without your tricks, come down with me.

YORK:
With you, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Hie you, gentle uncle.

CLIFFORD:
He shall not live your tyrant, so your valour
Does your revenble: you are made to live
Against infection and the hand of war,
That you may live your tyrant not.

MONTAGUE:
O, I have been thus bold to put mine power in mind
Of what you promised me.

KING HENRY VI:
The king, kindly were it,
That I could minister
To this most grievous needful day,
With downright payment, show in your brow
I am your sovereign.

YORK:
I am your subject, and most pleasonably
To Bolingbroke.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me, forget your evil;
For I will love you and I hate you not.

QUEEN HENES:
If I be, will not suffer me: by your freeness,
I will stand betwixt you and danger.

KING HENRY VI:
Nor night nor day no rest: it is as dangerous
To make bad dealings tame.

YORK:
Tush, man! let night come: I will unto the Tower.
The tiger will be cruel whiles it was,
And will be cruel whiles it was to wound.

KING HENRY VI:
Shall I bring thee to this exercise,
Where and how my son perform'd.

YORK:
Under my canopy will I go read
The secrets in these secrets,
Where you shall be employ'd;
Meantime, this will be done,
When I am cold in zeal.
Shall I go play the secret place?

RICHMOND:
Why, no, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Goose up the prince, and go about with him.

RICHMOND:
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the prince, my sorrow, and my sorrow,
To make the angels better:
Take on him, and put on him.

CLIFFORD:
When holy Harry told me, I saw
That which they of all the house did,
Being once again All-hallond eve.

MOPSA:
My lord, go;
And hire post-horses; I will be at your majesty
To bring him to you.

CLIFFORD:
Where will I bate
consortedly with the enemies of my sort?

MOPSA:
Where, when I am little, Bohemia,
Nor when I am little, thus I'ld have been
A horse and a royal gentleman.
See you these moads and these blind-fellows
To gnaw'd and tired legs?

TER:
Why, therefore Warwick, I dare
To put me down and reign thy days idle.

WARWICK:
So then you hope of gain your right.

YORK:
This achieved, or else 'twere lose,
For Henry still a subject.

WARWICK:
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Where nothing can he lose but his heart.

KING HENRY VI:
That is not Edward's heart:
Sweet gentle uncle, let me know my heart,
Why I am thus bold to take my leave of you
To speak against you in such a business.

GLOUCESTER:
When I am cold in zeal to yours,
When I do see your brows are mine,
Then Iawn as fast as takest
My son, that dare not call me brother,
Shall think me kinsman, and that I were not
Join'd with grief and these enemies.

WARWICK:
Well, I must be gone. Ah, wrangling thee!
And thou, brave Earl of March,
Art thou fortunate, by this deed,
To slay thy own enemy, and lie thou there?

KING HENRY VI:
Comfort, my lord; let's all come together.

WARWICK:
What means we come down?

KING HENRY VI:
Because of ourself,
Even thou my title of right and wrong,
Which but for the loss of thee,
Which was decreed, we did stay
From field to heel with him;
And thought upon no thought of him;
But shortly come after supper, twenty-five pound;
For by my head, the king's great kindred's dead,
And I by my head's arm look'd upon,
That only my foes were up,
And that the king's kindred were down.
For behold me now, how I have borne
In bloody days, how I am become'd!
Even thou, that am I sworn brother,
And never shame to any but with thee;
For all the sceptre that I bear thee
Might, or of this bed, how I have my will,
With downright payment, show so how thou canst procure,
And know how I am beguiled and surprised,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, thou mean'st not this ruth,
For how canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
And so break it, to live.

YORK:
I'll bear thee my body to some grave,
Some grave, some C-rerese;
Could be by murder, to close,
Or hollowly put on. Who strumpet,
That wrought it?

GLOUCESTER:
Villain, thou art as inhuman to murder.

YORK:
If thou be my remembrance, I'll give thee remedy
To put armour in my high will:
But if thou refuse, I'll give thee remedy:
But if thou fail'st--as God's name,
Then say, Scion's due by life usurp'd,
A merriment and a lusty thing;
For I will be revenged.

SLY:
I have no warrant.

WARWICK:
Threeukes of Clarence, and two kings,
To lay Richard down: but I'll single
one more revenge, to prove falsean mercy
To all the princes.

YORK:
While we reason here these two kings
Would be at the one, the one
The one at the other, some another
To depart the court and lay down their power,
As blameful as the great'stue
In moral paradise of kings.

CLIFFORD:
By their patience,
If 'gainst your right,
Armiest the Duke of Clarence,
And Montague, come hither:
I'll make a pause, my lord,
To quicken your neck when presently he hath cross'd
The prince my brother hath show'd
The desire of theblind seas,
Fill'd your hearts with these proclamations,
To tear you clean, and put you clean in mind
Of this All-Souls' late presaging dance.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet father, live, and I hope I'll victory
By fearing to the queen and her allies
That led you to this execution.

CLIFFORD:
Now bear this thought out of my mind;
And hear, good father, how he fell
From their bed, and how he glisters
The unstain'd possession of that hand
That did usurp the few worm of his opinion
And vouch

COMINIUS:
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of France is your brother's son,
And that you are more, than Duke of English lord:
The honours and thy house are mine:
Among them I can say God is the worst,
And all comforts are so soon forgot.

CLARENCE:
O piteous spectacle! that ended, that sad dog,
That laid the root in the usurping earth.
O Margaret, I fear,--

GLOUCESTER:
What! fear!

Beseech, how canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When thou shalt know thou art dead? and that even thou art
To shame unvulnerable, as thou art.

CLARENCE:
O deadly minnicious woman!
If God's just consent take hold,
Thou art as free from touch or soil with him.

GLOUCESTER:
Holy King! O, he is too cruel.

YORK:
More cruel, to bring you brotherhood in.

GLOUCESTER:
If you take leave and part; for 'tisore to right.

YORK:
Be patient, and I will stay my kingly throne.

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow then I wish'd a happy day.

YORK:
To-morrow then, we wish'd.

GLOUCESTER:
To-day!

QUEEN:
What then?

GLOUCESTER:
To-day, presently.

YORK:
Cry mercy, gentle father!

GLOUCESTER:
I would I had the faint and terrible effect of my power.
But I cannot with my soul these several confusions:

I cannot by the yea and no
To prick my finger, to make mine oaths
To this my vow: and, if my heart's weak,
But my withal doth fry ew.

GLOUCESTER:
That oath ITo God and these my hopes were good,
And that the people of this noble
Cade me thrive well: and, if I cannot,
Be patient till I please thee better,
In our better seeming, and then be ruled.

YORK:
I never saw nor heard of.

GLOUCESTER:
Though I am content to be a king,
I dare be a king by the yea.

YORK:
O, thouHow that birds of prey make me thrive!

GLOUCESTER:
How now, noble father!

YORK:
Doth he make me happy? by my soul,
If I did take flesh,--

GLOUCESTER:
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which I have forsworn.

YORK:
To-morrow, then:
He hopes to unvulnerable, proud Plantagenet,
And that thou wilt not live.

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou that we will, and that we may,
Though we cannot do, yet we'll
Wrench our power on the hateful use
Of man, the evil which we have committed
To the dead bodies and our heirs?

YORK:
That we may, if we will.

GLOUCESTER:
But 'twas you that made us rich,
Than misery can make us rich, by you.

YORK:
Anon, anon!

GLOUCESTER:
I would I were a kingical.

YORK:
Why, uncle, 'tis not your title of a sickness
Which puts me to 'scape. I have need to adorn;

And put your own power up to 't.

Of gracious order, by the just computation of

But you must trouble to dream of how you are

But to be heard, you will think you sweet Kate,

Clown:
Why, then it's so:
Eleven hours I spent to write it truth,
For it was against the queen of this.

AUTOLYCUS:

FLORCAS:
Alas, poor! I must think you.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, it is even so: yet I promised,
Upon penalty instruments, when I did the year:
He is within the circuit-work of law,
To bring you just and upright hearing of
======================================== SAMPLE 154 ========================================
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

ANTIGONUS:
He shall well know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
He shall bring you hear him o'er the senate,
Call'd the senate.

MENENIUS:
He shall do it:
Sir, if he may, by the means of man,
We shall to the senate and show our general louts!
He shall to Rome, and show happy days
To Rome of our Coriolanus.


MENENIUS:
What's o'clock?


SICINIUS:
Upon my mother's fault:
SICINIUS:
I would they had changed voices too!

MENENIUS:
Consider this:
This child is foolish, and I fear
Our Rome will not be a Mercy, one!

MARCIUS:
Be ruled by him.

MENENIUS:
If it were not pity, I should suborn;
This boy is not half so dear as some great
As is the coal of some unburnt.

MENENIUS:
If I could by his good report,
'Tis given freely.

COMINIUS:
But is it pregnant by your Eyes and your eyebrows?

MARCIUS:
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
My disposition, my disposition, my love:
And had he peace between where he did,
That honour IUS, the very man
That I am now to call'd, he would not
do't: one of these most cruel terms,
So hated, and so banish'd: but man, proud, to counterfeit,
I would had him potency enough
To that portion which should determine.

MENENIUS:
That's enough.

MARCIUS:
Come.

COMINIUS:
Look, here is the boot.

MARCIUS:
Pray now, let us go: I'll lean upon one crutch and fight
With t'other, to attempt it out, and fall
Into the common people's mind.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled by him.

COMINIUS:
Let him know't.

MARCIUS:
The gods begin to mock him.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let's home.

COMINIUS:
Let him not home to Rome, I'll lean
Where it fits not you to know.

 your tribunes:
You must retire yourself
To some private place or where your people's power is
If to the Capitol.

MENENIUS:

 Rome!

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
Now the people will come.

COMINIUS:
Let them be levied:
This afternoon, Tullus, is tullus'March.

MENENIUS:
If, by the staring hills
Which he treads, I will dew
My plackets wherewith the Volsces are bent,
To look upon my work, as on them
Where I am tied in pew. Please you, great Cominius;
To march with him to the Capitol
To be the people's officer.

COMINIUS:
To Rome, I tell you.

CORIOLANUS:
These your protest!

MENENIUS:
You do it nobly.

CORIOLANUS:
Your anointed king,
Even when the navel of your wills,
Appear'd to you in an hour before his majesty
Tame to speak your lordship.

MENENIUS:
If so, then,
Even as we joy, were you this country's citizens,
Would be so too rash in our request,
If we remember you as we mean.

VOLUMNIA:
Yet oft,
When they wish'd us to our country's good,
With downright payment, they will desire
To tread the people's bitterest.

MENENIUS:
How sometimes,
When I am thus thus thus thus thus bared,
Should I be heard, and thus my doing thus?

VOLUMNIA:
Even when we were born.

MENENIUS:
You must be told,
Or else his honour.

CORIOLANUS:
Your mother lives.

MENENIUS

And show your dear face, as I think,
As you will not flatter, go to it.

MENENIUS:
I do not like this flight of great justice,
Drawn, rather than unjustly, to strike
Where it fits not you to be.

SICINIUS:
Pray, be your highness, and I'll
For Rome in Corioli:
And yet, I know, I do not know what:
Nor I, it, nor any:
For most it caught me, the proudest:
I would not be the better for a belly;
For Rome is a lamb like a cat.

MENENIUS:
If the belly be quick, 'tis by no means valiant;
For the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here: you, I'll pull the k teeth
Of thisEdile! you'll not proud!

BRUTUS:
If he were proud I could wish you good for him
To comb your noddle with a custom,
I see 'em do not favour.

MENENIUS:
If he had no more spirit to be a mourner,
Down were seen't: I would he had some pity
In that respect.

BRUTUS:
There's some pity behind his hand:
O, let's not.

Citizens:
We will not make our bodies rich, and make us rich.
Come, bring us to our legs.

MENENIUS:
O, peace!
I will not make me speak.

SICINIUS:
Pray you, let's not to him.

MENENIUS:
Go, get you home; he must not come down.
I told you, he shall not come down:
I'll get you to my tent:
I told him what did our cause,
If he did return.

COMINIUS:
You shall not be talked with,
But hear more: I'll leave his friends
Than you, by your leaves give him cause
To come down to-morrow, by your leaves'T:
'Tis a sore thing to were wedding,
Not till then, by the entreaties he bear
To go before blood, by your free promise,
that honour shall be my wife and my child.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie! while she knit
A rhyme I learn'd him how:
He was not to be talked withal,
But so I am tied so fast, to say I would son:
If, by your means, come to me;
If you would not so, would you be content
To stay her tongue.

First Senator:
If she would not be content to die,
We should have some pity.

MENENIUS:
O, she shall still be ruled as we do,
As we would.

BRUTUS:
Marry, I will.

Citizens:
I do not smile when I am lack'd.

MENENIUS:
Now say, what's the matter, you dissentious
Speak to them?

BRUTUS:
This afternoon he did not attend us as we thought he would
entire our friends, that our general disgrace
Methought his friends are up at Tewksbury.

MENENIUS:
No, by him?

BRUTUS:
Right.

MENENIUS:
By his means, I had appea to him.

BRUTUS:
But, this afternoon, he had so set his friends
To yoke together: day, Part, part!

Meantime, when they had left, they called
for him; and indeed, I would they bate
him.

BRUTUS:
We should, sir, be so, in our wisdom,
Methinks we should be divided:
'Tis but one thing to the divptest;
Ay, or one that is the worst.

MENENIUS:
Ay, and one that is the most dangerous
By the ignorant way we can devise.

COMINIUS:
If he did jest, I would not shame to hear
What he was, and be perverse an say
His oath is of eternal treason.

MENENIUS:
He does well, I can tell you:
By the white tribunes, his brother, and by oath,
He is free as from touch or soil with our desire.

Senators:
God send us!

MENENIUS:
Away!

Both Tribunes:

How now! and my poor children,
I am thus afflicted with thy smiles,
So bold to accuse myself.

YORK:
O, pardon me, God! 'twas I
That seest thy heavy curse! O, death!

GLOUCESTER:
What! you knew my father,
Ill in his manner, nobleness;
Thy proud steeds are all faded, and needful:
Then weep, and give me leave, do curse thy
with giving no more curse to keep my pack from fasting:
What, heavy day, is this true?

WARWICK:
Mother, 'tis the determined respite of my
daughter; set on by my brother's will:
From whence, warriors; as instruction to persuade
Makes the Duke of Plantagenet, to know
What condition
of the game was lost when last we banished him.

YORK:
'Tis hardly to play, but they are
come to't.

WARWICK:
Mistake, your title? for that title of a
lower'd list, here in the parliament
The Lady Bona.

ICHORK:
I do remember it to some charge
That you have quietly resolve'd.

If that our general souls can with those

PRINCE:
Anon! what else?

KING LEWIS XI:
True, noble lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
If murdering me, I had been as cruel
with the people, to be so revenged on you.

YORK:
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged on me.

EXETER:
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard
The bitter sentence of the one so whom they so often have been
To prick the clouds with streaks of light
To fright and scorn at the one at the other:
By Tullus, there lies the game at
the last, by Marcius 'twixt you and
the king.

KING LEWIS XI:
And will I tell you this one,
Before all the din of war gan pierce the gods
Came me to the court?

QUEEN MARGARET:
To do me last, to do me last,
When I, your age, and the subject
Have fought with t'emper'd.

KING LEWIS XI:
Tyrants themselves wept when they were down.
But when they saw them, as swiftly as the posts could run
From uncles and cream.

DUKE YORK:
Yet would they not of us? why, then was there no need in
such a need to have a heart as great as yours, for howe'er it bade the
house of Lancaster?

WARWICK:
Because that I know it; and know it is
brief to leave ungentle to remember me why I should
desire to be inquired after.

YORK:
Why, what haste?

WARWICK:
Because that now it lies one three miles
There to lose my crupper, Buckingham.

KING LEWIS XI:
Whither?

WARWICK:
Because that way, some other way.

KING LEWIS XI:
Twice speed the weary way.

YORK:
O, then, my lord! My lord, I dare

The king unto the common people; and therefore follow me
and
thou, brave Earl of Warwick, with our thanks;
And to Edward's hand I seal'd unto him.

KING LEWIS XI:
But what said Northumberland as his last?

WARWICK:
He would not seem to know our mind,
Unless thou didst know 'tis my pawn:
But to conclude with truth, it is more than so,
Because both of us are ignorant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What says the king, when they shall know
Coriolanus is their sovereign,
Their bands i' the vouch against him.

YORK:
Ay, while he were great, some marvellous corrupt man
Did hack'd my service to this purpose
======================================== SAMPLE 157 ========================================
Not only my lord.

WARWICK:
So be thy glories! What but to-day
Lie in the princes name of Henry's enemies,
And utter ruin of the house of York?
Yet hath he left me no more,
To cheque my scandal with a report of his pride?

GLOUCESTER:
That jest with me? alas, 'tis but his policy
To haste unavoided by his hand:
But I am grown too late that till I could see him.

KING HENRY VI:
Where on this molehill will I sit up in chains,
Being the hare, that would bate him to the door
Of Bolingbroke, covering your sceptre with your hand,
I'll set upon you majesty.

CLIFFORD:
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen,
Who could fancy more than any,
To be thus taunted, and I cannot tell.

MONTAGUE:
Tut, I saw them and could tell him what I saw
That we had done together: O, it is as it appears,
From our faults, to you.

KING HENRY VI:
Barely castle call I this from Lord Clarence,
Where I heard this news of noble Gloucester?

MONTAGUE:
Yea, husband, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Barely castle call I this from Lord Clarence?

MONTAGUE:
Most royal sir, I thank your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
Commend me to Lord Dorset, noble duke;
Recover breath, widowly Richmond, and all of France:
Let me pray before I take my death's curse again.

OXFORD:
'Tis not my fault, but mine is law.

SOMERSET:
My soul is sweet, and I am strong:
If we will have you strong and prosperous your lord,
Then I being tyrannous, may make mine dreams
To quit your dreams of traitors' pernicious sleep,
And entertain a cheerful disposition,
To entertain these fair sleeps,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days
And fright our cheerful thoughts with comforts.

PRINCE EDWARD:
What, will you go to France?

MONTAGUE:
Cha, good nurse, answer to this:
In commona, in good sooth,
Your head'sore to the top of a great matter.

GREMIO:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I will follow you.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
What is your will, sweet uncle?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Away, you will not be tied to your gates:
Let signior me, and after my way.

BUSHY:
Why, gentle uncle, give me leave awhile:
I'll to your tent; and be gone.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What haste shall you make toward these Castle?

BUSHY:
Will not suffice; therefore follow me.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go to, go to France: 'tis good:
Anon, I part; and bound your company,
Let's go.

GREEN:
We must enter in, to help the Duke of Clarence:
Ere you were queen, yea, your stars
Shall fly to the foul feet
Where your darling cousins are: they must not show their power,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the thorny Caucasus.
Bushy, what haught Northumberland
To the traitor's children and safeguard of your loves!

Both:
The Earl of March,
Our trusty brother, unless he show himself a woman
More worth than any thing;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
By mine honour,
If e'er thou see any grace in't,
Dost thou make me happy by he was the Duke of York?

GLOUCESTER:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to him.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stay, my lord, to brook delay:
The thought of yield piece of work is foolish,
Which craves as desperate an execution.

GLOUCESTER:
How! know you on which side
Thou on's'? why, then mine is mine.

SAMPSON:
Why, then my name is John Mowbray,
ukes fault enough too, another thing to the king:
by this herald, I should say,
time, thy proud father,
Methinks the kingner, Henry the true heir,
And all his brothers, as that valiant Duke of York,
Are clear'd in this true fight.

KING HENRY VI:
by this I know, they are almost clear:
by-morrow, 'tis with false faith,
so by simple words and such as this seeming,
I cannot but urge his hateful luxury
To faithful service.

First Lord:
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
Where on my conscience and my soul
I heard him say and swear,
Was John Mowbray, his brother there,
That did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point:
That only now he hath cause to grieve
When he did see his shame.

Second Lord:
Why, gentle my lord, let's hear him speak.

JOHN Mowbray, what then?

Both:
God save your grace! and well come.

MENENIUS:
Mine, with the consent of supreme peace,
And soundly too: your bodies shall be spent,
And The rewards thereof pay no privilege is quite when
Like one good take'd upon a subject.

KING HENRY VI:
Give me leave to go.

MAMILLIUS:
I am bound as well as I was,
In all the days of year, on line
To Lammas-trees in our country.

First Lord:
Be Lammas-trees all?

JOHN Mowbray, rough not one whit.

MUM:
For shame, come to me, let's hear you speak.

MUMICHARD:
My gracious lord, let me know my fault:
If you will not yield to our complots,
Then, seeing 'em, pity maketh me;
For 'twere pity of your brother's life;
For how is it with him, and how is't fit
That we may arm us to encounter you.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by your means, my lord.

MUMICHARD:
From your means we were put to death,
'Tis rigor'd to endure the worst.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lord, let me know my fault:
If you will take it not your part
To comb my noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paintements to your eyebrows and your eyebrows,
Be blamed for your kind uncle how I'll give death
And in that shame doth my justice charge you to be
Whoop'd the golden bed of majesty.

WARWICK:
Where is my lord, where be these lands?
Where is my deserving? and, in requital of your majesty,
If you be contented, that you thus are free?

KING HENRY VI:
I am content:
Five years I have been absent in court;
For testimony whereof shall I lend
To up my rest and come.

JOHN MORTIMER:
Sound, trumpets! let's home.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's home.

OXFORD:
My wanton!

WARWICK:
Why, that is not so.

KING HENRY VI:
Let's home.

OXFORD:
To bid our brother king by your means,
He were our subject as the people's officer.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

OXFORD:
Where is the Duke of Clarence? where is he?

CLARENCE:
As in a loyal man, false hag!

WARWICK:
Sweet brother, stand up to the siege of loving-man.

KING HENRY VI:
Suppose, my lords, that this simple town
Should be shut, and be closed with my false hag.

WARWICK:
Why, that I were thus resolved to stay,
By yielding to our complices and his oath's unjust;
If either of you, or else depart,
Taken the count of the sure and always.

KING HENRY VI:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even here,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
No humble suitors press me from the native right,
To weed my vice with another benefice:
'Tis death to

I cannot speak: I cannot sometime in prison a
medlar. My lord, you do not mind to turn into a
foul wrinkled Richard; for what you speak, I'll take in
foboke your invectives, for there is no more mercy for the poor thing
is ne'er till eating and drinking are put
down. Now, lords, take the unfeigned oaths
To fight with gentle Richard: sure, I'll do him right, Aumerle,
when I am cold in zeal to this sport.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, that I were damn'd for this place of peace,
Where I should be finds, that index
Would, that index were subject to my wish,
And wrath o' the law would not be yoke!
O, that I were as great as I am,
With this goodly Duke of York,
Or that I had him, by the just computation of
From yon grey his forehead and nay, and butcher'd at
him, ere I did look on him:
but you will be king, and he and I
Will make a dearth in this revolting land.

YORK:
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
And were you content to entertain his glories
In any substantial manner, as I am,
Shall nothing benefit your well-will'd knowledge,
But by your entreaty too hard-hearted oath,
To weed my vice and let his grow
Where it did worship and execute.

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
No, not that name was given me at the font,
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
That I have worn so many winters out,
And know not where where where I live.

QUEEN:
O, thou know'st, I fear thee not:
March sadly after; therefore let march.

KING RICHARD II:
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to him:
If she have trust'd you more than twenty thousand strong
Than all the sceptres that have broke
And scatter'd the poor news.

QUEEN:
If this defend my loyalty, then 'twascy
 should by and by.

KING RICHARD II:
Well, I bear it myself: if this defend
Thou bear the sceptre, and that is not the worst,
Then Ich you, created you Duke of York,
Who made the forest tremble.

QUEEN:
Away! let's hear.

KING RICHARD II:
Tut, I bear it, bear it, and bege.

QUEEN:
Thou know'st, I can bear it with thee;
But thou are not sick, angry, king,
For what thou wot, I am no humble;
No, not that is winters mean to wail.

 winters:
I will follow thee and be gone.

KING RICHARD II:
What, will you go?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Return unto thy lord.

KING RICHARD II:
O, bid me joy:
Saints do I do not joy, for what I have said
Shall be the winding dust that is there which stains
The swords of soldiers and gentlemen.

QUEEN:
Well, I come.
And, uncle, you shall be the messenger,
And come after him.

KING RICHARD II:
Brother, farewell: what presence must not know
From where you do remain let paper show;
And what your enemies are, that abound
In your revenged to-morrow,
But owe you this paper: I'll take it
To see your pleasure. Come; let me go.

DUKE OF YORK:
Let paper show.

QUEEN:
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
Bidid him farewell: what presence must not know
From where you are, the lord and sovereign.

DUKE OF YORK:
He is your sovereign.

KING RICHARD II:
So I would you did, were you sworn to his oath,
Be perfect for this new-made traitor,
Whom you didst sworn to fight at odds
More than for the father's skull:
But since you sought him, our lord,
To thread the knot

GLOUCESTER:
At least,
When men were fond, I smiled and said 'How.'

DUKE OF YORK:
O how that passing empty duteous prince befits my heart!
For then my husband's lands I freely give thee mine.

GLOUCESTER:
What! he lands, his lands, his courts, and his terms
Pluck'd from their dust and all by Bolingbroke.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What what is his name?

GLOUCESTER:
 Wales.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The name of Oxford?

GLOUCESTER:
By the name of Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
If that name be not Oxford, thou honour'd
In the letters patent that he hath to protect
Betwixt his teeth and his teeth clean,
He should here find his teeth clean'd with teeth
To peck theings and hearers, as to Jove's skull,
Were bid for gravesites and to make coats
Wherein he stood, as I thought,
I pray'd him how he singled away,
As I thought him for the grave he might be,
Or that the common people did mistake
To take so deep an oath, and broke
 oaths to't.

Lord Mayor:
Look, here come the citizens sit down.

ANT:
Bid them challenge:
O, I have heard it said
That these powers, being by, and by,
That shall not be shut once again, give consent
To marry us to some fashion,
More than the common people's power,
Shall feel this day, and go about it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Shall we be divided?

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow:
To-day, presently.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Your lordship knows no cause to be;
The mere deputy cannot weigh the matter;
For examine of what he should say
The loss of one that would be so much,
And yet his nature never in the fight
To do or undo it.

GLOUCESTER:
He'll bear thee company:
If he take it not too, 'tis then as bitter
To prick the gods of soldiers,
Shall sure drop out, and usurp the moon.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is your highness' pleasure I shall do
But make it bitter to you. Leave me, he shall go about with me;
Let him not live to say I am done:
The thing I have, by right is right,
And therefore, if left earth, to rain I do it,
The mere conceit of unquiet slumbers
To seek out sorrow that I am,
Will be breathless and in my large.

GLOUCESTER:
For every thought I see, I make but one
And this faint planet of our flesh.

BUSHY:
I cannot help it now:
Now must my soul digest
His angry report; and when the rage of heaven,
Shall quick-falling, and his accursed flag
Tullis set high in heaven,
And all the rites of the ceremonious world
Shall graceless be preserved.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Richard, I come thee here; speak.

GLOUCESTER:
O, know you this daring-shapen chaos of justice
From forth to hell; and you daringly lead
To bear the matter out with a looker-on
That cannot be avoided.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my heart
I come, and do a frantic tale:
The rather had I did the thing I did,
Withal I would crave,
The which would be little better.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell;
How fit you cavilling me with our smies!
Methought the king at once gave me half,
And with that hand that did fast run
Fast twenty thousand men.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, 'twas thought the king did all this for Calais.

GLOUCESTER:
Think you now, when he did see the like,
He did perceive it not:
And when upon the next course, he noblely cross'd the table,
And from the instrument scotched to begin.
Lest he hence, and joy? how might he fare?

I cannot help it now,'t with the sword.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yea, hear me I weeping.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, but thou wrong'st it now:
May it please your highness to call me now?

KING HENRY VI:
I aim'd when I supposed you were gone.

YORK:
O, let me be doubt-faded with tears.

KING HENRY VI:
If I could reach thee with twenty3 or fourscore pounds
There was some whit lesser than this man's neck
And twenty I strong'd myself in the kill'd.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O God! I knew thee not--

KING HENRY VI:
Why, 'twas I; who knew I no title
from our last attempt.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou of Clarence, know who I am.

GLOUCESTER:
Plantagenet.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that thee of Clarence is dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I would thou hadst my son a thousand swords,
To fight as fast as York could fall down.

KING HENRY VI:
But is it dead already? 'Tis slept, for thine ear'st.

QUEEN MARGARET:
The ghost of Warwick and the haught insulting man,
With known blood by him and hearing of our succession,
Have marr'd together: of such encounters,
As now far as York and Camillo were:
And of that we heard not how he fell to death,
 nor how he pity'd the beggar that miscar,
Because our highness told him of pawn,
Which dare breatw it him for the grave:
And wheres report from this most woful murder'd,
That too mighty Jove himself did bear the body,
And, to break the moral of another benefice,
Yet lives, Plantagenet,
None but thou.

GLOUCESTER:
The most peerless piece of earth, I think,
And I am tied to hell perpetual.

KING HENRY VI:
Tush, man, you have stol'n upon your majesty:
Fear you the tyrannous passion of citizens
To prick the finger of him that made you Duke of York.

YORK:
March sadly after; this is the last:
To-morrow, to-day:
To-day, not to-day.

KING HENRY VI:
Away! let's see: he longs to have
The present benefit of his majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
But, come, he is not so kind to be his sovereign:
When were he twenty-hours old, he would be
Mine advocate, and still in favour
For his open guilt of choice.

YORK:
Now, brother of Clarence, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Are come hither: to-morrow hold;
To-day, not to-day; presently:
To-morrow: yet, in honour, as we thought
To stay, and not to stay, we determined
Our last vesture of revenge.

KING HENRY VI:
Look, how our lands are green and yet we lean:
The lands that we have, our thankfulness,
Shall be to repose and make enrich'd our shining star;
Our forward son shall be levied again,
And presently our thanks and loving friends,
Shall be the glittering sun that shines
No further than his proud-leiver'd sun.

GLOUCESTER:
He that with willing soul
Adopts thee not;
Hath not the quarrel of white and black
His pride?

YORK:
O, no more, my lord;
For that I have said that idle weeds are fast
Wherein thou liest in sap and dedicate
To the entrance of this feastensed king.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet widow, be not so me;
I am content ye wot not how to stand;
Daughter, tender cousin! when I am cold.

CLARENCE:
Cold grace the while, grief, shall smooth thy looks
With sweet discourse, but hearts with sorrow and sorrow
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good; and better 'twere his.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy father's name I hear;
Thy life name, dear God

GLOUCESTER:
Tell me, my lord; and you shall find it any more.

KING HASTINGS:
Why, that you may live this afternoon, and I longer.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, hold, hold; I'll try this afternoon:
What day so heavy I may ride due to-day,
When I should breathe this news in pain.

KING HASTINGS:
Tut, I liveth, I never injured:
Tut, I liveth; and these two days
To heal their hearts with these swelling tears.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, tell me whether I will or no,
Whoe'er it be, pity, or whether
Glomest will be the meeting of the two kings.

KING HASTINGS:
If I were dead, I would in the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Then Julius Caesar would have said we were sure,
That Julius Caesar had been in league with him;
Thereon would he had some pity sitting in the clouds,
That young Mars had encounter'd upon:
But when goes this tell me, daughter brotherbury,
Where is that valiant crook-led haughty Montague,
That tales of the happy fathers and brother
Of such as you fancy:
But say, where is Romeo?

JULIET:
Where is he, gentle Paris?
Condemned villain, I cannot tell:
Sweet widow, I know not where;
Or from this place, where is your darling Rutland?
Look, when I am cold in zeal,
Be patient; I will not show my face
Until my tongue-tied husband bid me and come to you.

CLARENCE:
Whoa, my husband, will not call you husband?

JULIET:
I am, that am like you.
If lusty young rebel or foul-hearted gentleman,
Come hither, comb-logic. How now, you are welcome.
If not, you three KING HENRY VI
And four thine, I thank thee not;
For thou and these thy sons were together,
And interchangeably met, for wanton marriage:
The younger then is Duke of York,
And I from the consent of all,
To form a Duke of York.

KING HENRY VI:
What!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Brother, thou me alone; thou art me king:
A king, and I sworn to his.

KING HENRY VI:
Beow, but I am not lawful king;
I must be content:
What is your title? and 'tis,
The crown of kings and queens?

QUEEN MARGARET:
More than all the sceptres are:
A man, I pray thee, are you queen.

KING HENRY VI:
Yes, by myself; and from my necessity
Let general welcome you and your fair princess, to be so kings.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What's yourContent, uncle?

KING HENRY VI:
Content thee, gentle son, of what?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Things sweet to taste, that thou shouldst not be my husband!

KING HENRY VI:
Why, thou but widow,--gillest thou live.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Sweet widow,--gillows to thine eye.
Thy death-bed is too bloody for thee
Merely, too boisterous, to my bed.

KING HENRY VI:
What, will not banish me here till thou hast
A heart of wreak in me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Romeo.

KING HENRY VI:
He does not seem to me; I'll lean
Twenty-three days.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, then I heard thee say, pity me,
How I thought it good to hear
The mighty tribunes, and myself, were past all shame
To Marcius, and to Marcius.
O, then the good gods forbid!

PRINCE EDWARD:
We had but one, the one and the poor child,
To be at enmity with the the other did.

EDWARD:
Yes, I heard thee say, but thou strikest it
Than shame to ungrgot.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Be patient, wretched woman! Did you hear
That I had befall'n the child,
And that thou hear

TRANIO:
Hail he! Is't glad to lack
My Lucio's mockery. But, admits no title to your crown?
Before I make thee open-pity to another,--
As crown'd so my poor boy,
Didst send me forth to purchase honour
And what I am, I do it to the death.
I'll give this cur the hand: if I do remember,
I'll give him and undertake the same day.

BENVOLIO:
This gilt know, good father, the beseech.

LUCENTIO:
The beseech says nothing.

TRANIO:
Gentlewoman, the very beadsmen of love.

LUCENTIO:
True! a very month old.

BENVOLIO:
Beseech you, sir, were you in request to give the queen a
burthen: I were told you he was come of your house;
 only this day.

TRANIO:
And I wish'd sweet mastership to a mistress of me.

BENVOLIO:
Why, they say nothing but jollosies. I have heard my friend
Will play the housewife with me this afternoon:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eye'd of his odd behavior,
And therefore idle to one that does not think,
We render you this afternoon his clothes an
a crow, to put you to 'tself in mind.

BENVOLIO:
O, may not one of you take it?

MERCUTIO:
If the devil have given us any,
Yet
'Tis pity he cannot do that count.

BENVOLIO:
Look, sir, here comes a fellow: never heard of him
'Tis known but to be loud and and merry,
Such as you to durst not,
Lest he be heard and hewn and I can hear
And therefore be patient, and so he sort,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To avoid the envy.

BENVOLIO:
Sir, I tell you this:
Your friends are valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to him.

MERCUTIO:
This may prove good, or bad, in me,
If you report me this fair mean.

BENVOLIO:
My ladies both, good day to you,
To me, and to mine, and my nurse,
To teeming you with our late decree.

KING RICHARD III:
Give me leave, I will follow you.

BENVOLIO:
What says he traitors?

MERCUTIO:
Beseech you, my lord; I will follow you.

KING RICHARD III:
We thank you, gentle daughter, to your mother,
And thank you both. Hoo! hark! I thank your ladyship;
We are not to be talked on, but to
come down and in our pleasure.

BENVOLIO:
You will not leave us: I'll rather come down the hill
With a gentler scolding crook:
Your choice is up in arms,
Which you'll out of noise. Come, go with us;
A lady's champion.

ROMEO:
O, I am too angry.

BENVOLIO:
Come, sit on me: I know you not
how to tame a flower.

ROMEO:
So, I know,
 you will not be the flower of my choice:
If you affect the way.

BENVOLIO:

ROMEO:
Fairly offer'd, were I the revenue that
 you do pass, and, I pray thee,
So come as you will, were you content
to spend the time to end it all.

ROMEO:
Prove me, I must think there's any more of it
That I shall hereafter have to court you?

BENVOLIO:
Tut, man; I know it.

ROMEO:
'Tis the way
To speak, and therefore, I pray thee, tell me,
In what you say, you will not believe
That I have been thus envious;
If not, I'll believe, but will be thus:
I pray, go fit you to the custom and come
To pedlar; let me know't.

BENVOLIO:
One word, good cousin! the friar.

Well, he must do so:

Yes, good madam.

If she does but smile, I report her kind words
As honest as any cordial lover;
Asade the man in cave, and hide her face;
Such is the stamp of some impatient humour,
As is a mad man's descend.

LEONTES:

Enough, my lord.

PAULINA:
Enough, my lord:
In what?

EMILIA:
Not stamps, peace!

PAULINA:
Why, 'tis yours and these the hills
Which you are loath to bear:
Your lady and your father were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto him.

LEONTES:
Sir, I must report,
For I will play the orator
As if
I were a baby still. Who goes there, no matter for the ill,
That I respect you?

EMILIA:
O, no, he is health.

PAULINA:
By such good a person, thou madman.

EMILIA:
Now he is in health, I can tell you:
Marry, they are sent for to of him.

EMILIA:
To see his bottom of modesty.

EMILIA:
No, I can't tell you, sir, nor I can't.
Look, sir, my lady's face, and I'll say
I'll speak boldly, for show your face,
And make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in black ornaments,
To buy souls of this feast.

Should I were dead, yea, here I'ld not

Sweet madam, your majesty is too true:
Prove it, my lord.

PAULINA:
Let's hear't. Come, ladies, go,
To meet me at the Tower.
What, is't not your highness' high disgrace
Marry? I must be
The first that gives entrance to my power?
The shame mostimation of the poor thing,
For that 'twixt your extremes and my poor one
Shall bear the benefit of dignity.

EMILIA:
Well, I must do't:
I think, if you be the leading of my foe,
I'll bear you of my lord,
And I'll rid you of your height
Before I would be tied to one crutch and fight.

LEONTES:
Brother, I have trusted my soul allill to do
I' the need and I are all hopeless of your suffering;
For I have caught extreme cold hate,
Where I have been going; and I dare

The comfort that some of us has,
That is your body's exercise, and mine,
Makes me most accustomable.

LEONTES:
Do't, my lord.

PAULINA:
Who are you, sir?

EMILIA:
The grave is embassies;
I' the eyes of, and there the heart
Of generosity, to express
Aclusive tale:
Most likely!

LEONTES:
Do't.

PAULINA:
I am too bold, 'tis not thy that goes
To make the senseless gods look as clear
Of this true which they so seem to fear.

LEONTES:
One seven years, a most grievous labour,
Among two buckets, if they were at once
Did flow from whence it e'er:
Had the gods some among you, some among you

So to the life-wearied flesh. Eyes, look yourior

But hand you this one, for thy love,
And neither of you.

DUKE OF YORK:
This three-ton, by thee; for thy love,
Starr'd with the utterance of thy utterance,
Thy wife, whom thou detestable must love,
Doth it not pity, to hear thee say
How nice the prince's heart is,
When she doth bid good for chastisement.
O, think you, and minister of government,
The common people swarm like summer flies;
And whither fly?

DUKE OF YORK:
I will not go, I'll back till I please myself:
For, Richard, I am a king;
And therefore pardon me, grieve you I should be moved
To what my tongue was, when he did nett.

QUEEN:
Who, when he said he heard of the queen,
His noble cousin lord?

DUKE OF YORK:
He would not seem to know me.

QUEEN:
O, thou seem'stWhy they unto me;
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath.

KING RICHARD II:
Be thou revenged by me, and let me live.

QUEEN:
By revenged medham.

QUEEN:
By this, he would not spare to gird the gods;
He would not spare to gird the gods.

KING RICHARD II:
Be thou revenged by me:
He's by I count.

QUEEN:
By revenged thou revenged him.

KING RICHARD II:
Then 'twere pity he did not spare
That which did him time,
More than that is common grief,
Which made him so penitent.

QUEEN:
The shame of that misery afford no moan,
But for the enjoying of thy royal person,
Imagine I had had said farewell already.

KING RICHARD II:
O gracious lord, bethink thee of thyself;
Believe not that thy sorrow can so unafresh.

QUEEN:
What's that to thee?

KING RICHARD II:
But there's some pity sitting in thy clouds,
That will not show thee this complaint:
O, take it, and see it how it doth it glor'd,
Since thou so high above our heads ere this land
Had paper bonds: then let paper show,
And thou shalt be satisfied: thou shalt know what I can,
That thou mayst prove content of thisHa!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I cannot do that feat, to know.

KING RICHARD II:
O thou know'st, forget it!

BUCKINGHAM:
Thou love'st me, and I will love thee.

KING RICHARD II:
Aumerle, thou wilt not.

QUEEN:
I'll love thee.

KING RICHARD II:
Darest thou not?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is Bagot, there are your two lords?

KING RICHARD II:
Madam, my lord.

QUEEN:

KING RICHARD II:
 Bagot! my lord!

KING RICHARD II:
What is the matter, my lord?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Come your highness, and call the Lady Bona.

KING RICHARD II:
Say, Somerville, what says my loving lord?
And, by my soul, I cannot tell
Whether true peace is made, for both of us
are free.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, therefore 'tis mine:

SOMERSET:

And in this hurly they will come,
Even as the glorced of the good gods,
Showing both their pride and smiling

And, with a falling, he will not spare to gird the gods:
As many joy, Fitz'd with care,
Among the infinite doings both,
To nothing but despair.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Think you, my lord, that I have done this brave fellow,
And that he'ld bear him, whose cowardice
To talk one end where he was, was't possible.

KING RICHARD II:
I never heard of him.

LORD FITZWATER:
Why, how now, noble cousin!
I tell you, that in the brother's welcome I have
To Bolingbroke, as before I came by,
To speak with you and your cousin Hereford,
The Lords of Ross and Willoughby, have said farewell:
But here you come, unrespective.

KING RICHARD II:
The sullen Duke of Buckingham is come.

BUCKINGHAM:
Was it you will not make me know
What noble tribunes are you to depose?

KING RICHARD II:
The queen with all the lords in arms
Have said, my lord, we will play
The orator, if you please.

BUCKINGHAM:
No doubt, no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

KING RICHARD II:
So it should seem
To me, the king, to be so great.

BUCKINGHAM:
Great lord! I come, to what o' the business:
Truly, with unquiet diligence,
Step forth mine advocate;
And, if so, with some unlook'd accident,
Yet that my great power, policy,
Among the popular praise I bear
Now, to be so bold in terms
As, to be so tender in subject to my soul!

KING RICHARD II:
Even as kings shake; and, as I am
In one kind, some some aay, some a gay, some a child,
Boding, black, varying slave,
Even of the wars of York and of the two,
That one being fear'd of all, as fearing one another
Against the advantage of his person:
If all else fail, 'tis by murder'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Be patient;
We'll surety him.

KING RICHARD II:
Who ever would have thought the prince had been deposed?

BUCKINGHAM:
Are enemies to proud Bolingbroke,
And all to death: no lord of him is name'd
To any countenance her natural charms?

GLOUCESTER:
Marry, that 'scape is not your highness' worth:
Highly one subject.

KING RICHARD II:
Minion, thou liest. Is't your highness' pleasure I may
Confess who you are when you speak to me?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where it seems best to conceal our meaning,
The king by my good amorous Henry.

KING RICHARD II:
Yea, looks where bloody Clifford comes!

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I cannot but show myself a keen whate'er I
Can make my glory up in thisroud queen's allies?
Ere long I'll visit York, that 't make me old.

EDWARD:
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia, from
The king of soldiers; who attended at my feet
In secret ambush on the Duke of York
And graves of royal kings.

YORK:
My lords, at my feet, and with these my sons,
To honour me as the king is my idolatry,
These my sons, these my thorns,
My crowns and my stocks; these my sons,
My brother, and my nurse; these my sons,
Although bearing misery, I desire my life
Once more to look on him.

WARWICK:
What valiant sons, like to my heart's redemption,
Have I here been!

YORK:
Three of them, as I can,
That would not

ou crown'd Henry!

KING HENRY VI:
Which Henry shall help to come, but cannot help,
An affable and still-building queen.

YORK:
Royal commanders, be in readiness:
For why, they stay within this hour:
By-morrow's enemies is past,
And therefore delay not your weeping eye;
For if you faint, as fearing to do so,
Come not, fill another room in hell.

KING HENRY VI:
O Plantagenet,
Stay, Clifford, and let him be king;
For in a Christian climate never
Would I live down so long.

CLIFFORD:
Where king you are, sword to sword;
And all my followers to the ground
Are fire-hot steel;
Your friends are up, and Warwick rages.

YORK:
If I revolt, off goes not with me;
But you are darken'd with your enemies' feet,
For I am darken'd with your enemies' head,
And do not know what is your daring-foot
Was ever encounter'd, were it not?

KING HENRY VI:
We'll never leave his death-bed till eating and fast
Endured our days of bloody days,
Which now his pride achieved with bloody axe.

YORK:
 never,
Taste of it; if he show us his wounds
Then say unto me, I'll give him pity.
And let a thousand people mourn with me.

KING HENRY VI:
O Plantagenet, thou art perfect then, our days
In Woodstock'st, the Duke of Exeter.

CLIFFORD:
And have we thought it good to have
Two days we were at the one.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven!

YORK:
The pity of the both are good.

RICHARD:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of you.

YORK:
I am afraid to your soul, and I fear;
If heaven revenge, for my soul's parting with the earth.

EDWARD:
So please you, lords, to think of me.

YORK:
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and you of him.

YORK:
Good queen, be patient. Hear me, lords; I'll fawn upon thee.

KING HENRY VI:
What farewell? what, I fear?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Marry, we three, and will make a solemn vow;
Two years together, two thousand years together, shall ere once.

YORK:
I'll bear thee jointif to the king by my word:
By loyal proof of friendship we were all,
That common blocks were fast, and false horses;
There lay, to troublify thee royally,
Like to a tenement or pellet farm:
I am too mean a subject for thy captain's fire,
To prick thy finger, being no more angry.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, I do not mean to be at environ'd
With one that are too proud:
A man at least, I'll lean unto,
And in the towns, as he willeeds,
To prove so bloody, so he will fly.

YORK:
What fear, man?

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, dog, while thou speak'st.
Now, therefore, be ruled by your means,
In happy breasts you crave no discipline,
In loving arms you practise'd,
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
But to a just and envy you the commons:
But, usurpity, ere you were king,
With what contempt, you might as well go down.

GLOUCESTER:
Then Julius Caesar lost my heart;
And, by the fault of thee, by thee,
Who hither am abet,
Hast thou so become? by heaven, I'll
Give my condemn'd to another cut,
Who is of fourscore pounds a year.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet madam,--
What dost thou make here? by my lord's means?

GLOUCESTER:
By the consent of all, I seal you this
That you are the cause of it.

YORK:
I think no less.

GLOUCESTER:
The holy mark of Henry's years,
And my dear cousin, by his good leave,
May make his past life or end.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, I canst not revel such Troy with words,
But thou shalt desire sheer
======================================== SAMPLE 168 ========================================
 perceived and profess
To friends that do't, you'll rejoice
That ne'er I heard this news.

Then, since the measure done, I tell you
That this king is dead:
And I, to blame his gentle promise,
To report of him alive, am prepared
To encounter more unaccustom'd than formerly
We did minister.

EDWARD:
What cursed foot wanders this while I stand here?
Methinks these Plantagenets, that of all.

CLIFFORD:
I cannot tell:
The king's brother is gone to repattery;
And, seeing himself so horrible,
The King straight hath lost his holy thoughts;
And, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
Imagine I had been thus afflicted with
All proofs of necessary love
Shall else have touch'd upon me.

RICHARD:
O, let my friend know't!

EDWARD:
I'll hear no more.

MONTAGUE:
How! knows he of this?

RICHARD:
More of him anon.

YORK:
What whisper you, lords?

WARWICK:
Suppose you this is your policy,
To come to clearer knowledge withal.

YORK:
While we reason here what degree they are chosen
More than the chosen queen is your policy,
Even as the common people's officer.

RICHARD:
 and even as praises,
And darkly too.

YORK:
If it be not too much:
O, know, I, as we love the people,
Our desire is to ally mine.

RICHARD:
O, ye're never ruled by me,
In those foundations we graft'd our design,
But most himself, by some unlook'd accident,
That, by the infant, is sick and melancholy,
We tread the path that thou tread'st rivers never even in the earth.

YORK:
Where's he wounded?

WARWICK:
 at Ely House.

KING HENRY VI:
There is too much sadness in your majesty,
Which is too cruel to dwell
In shadows of his enemies' backs:
Bethink you, but of the cause,
And trust my strong correction.

YORK:
If I could reach him,
'Tis with false honour; and that is too dangerous.

KING HENRY VI:
Look, here comes your majesty.

YORK:
If without your tricks you found attach
A crown to the usurping root of his course,
Which sixteen years we have seen very bitter.

KING HENRY VI:
Too dangerous, to be so bold in our judgment
! There comes your majesty.

MARCIUS:

RICHARD:
Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

KING HENRY VI:
How! traitor!

YORK:
Who is; and, by his highness' years,
Return'dures not
To this neighbour, a haughty spirit
To fight so out and not on me.

WARWICK:
What is his name?

MARCIUS:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you.

YORK:
Why, so my heart is yours;
For I will fight and be down--

KING HENRY VI:
Who else?

WARWICK:
Slandering a while, you honour.

KING HENRY VI:
But of all disposition, warriors.

YORK:
'Tis no less
Than one that can live.
I think the king is dead?

WARWICK:
And is it your high will be good or bad?

WESTMORBISH:
If your request be poor, you'll drown your shame
With giving me glory, making me glory of fear.

KING HENRY VI:
Such is the indictment of the two arch- queens;
Counting you not one but of the royal house?
Where are your mess of sons and queens?

YORK:
Where are your enemies, if you be not of your tenderness?
The most arch of your sighs signify
That I have ever the king permitted me by my foe.

KING HENRY VI:
Ere I were then the lord of Henry the widow's,
The Dauphin and the French king,
These high sceptres, these Sirches to you,
That you must be extremity admitted them,
Were you contented to furnish us
Our royal throne, like
======================================== SAMPLE 169 ========================================
 widow and my wife;
And then comes she to me, who was wont to say,
And was to be said, and begin and speak,
Till our were told of, to give and bid us two,
To whom we thought it was an illevish.

PETRUCHIO:
That was madly spoken, madly spoken,
Which the veryest excuse
Your coming tongue, and that is not so,
Methinks you should leave yourself no more:
If you had the desire to speak, would you have been
The man you are, and you
Me; there would you'ld have been some comfort
In your beauteous, so happy were you;
If you could as fitly have met home,
Being ne'er so like.

KATHARINA:
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, by himself, by
And by the sceptre of his hand, by
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, and I
Drinking his noise, and knee
Takes on me to be acquainted with.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with a pox!

KATHARINA:
What, with a pox! give, go:
I have sat and slept above some fifteen year or more,
That almost the year and years were all brought me;
Now here come with me in the mean night.

TRANIO:
And so have I, boy:
That's good; and there an end.

KATHARINA:
I slew none but I, sir,
When I did see him dead.

PETRUCHIO:
O, but he was born to my son:
I can you tell me you'd that I do lament him.

KATHARINA:
And would you not then have thought to kill him?

PETRUCHIO:
For what miscarries he bore my cousin's death?

KATHARINA:
No, by my heart, I did not kill him;
But he my strong and sulphurous cousin's.

PETRUCHIO:
 seeing you, you know you do.

KATHARINA:
Now I know your mind; and it is best.

PETRUCHIO:
My soul is my body's valour,
The happy it is to be thus afflicted.

KATHARINA:
How namely lenity to one that
Did but kill my brother's heart?

PETRUCHIO:
When didst thou kill my brother?

KATHARINA:
When didst thou kill my heart,
And do you think that I did so?

PETRUCHIO:
O, yes, I'll do it:
If you didst bear a wife for the poorest piece,
Then mightst thou do that feat, a thousand waiting
To make a dauphin and a father for the third.

KATHARINA:
I thank your grace for your motion.

PETRUCHIO:
Now I come. What fit is this, you make your hearts like
Your oath enrolled in mine.

KATHARINA:
Know you this lesson, boy? and you set aside.

PETRUCHIO:
Me, none, I know this virtue boy.

KATHARINA:
No, by his word, sweet Kate.

PETRUCHIO:
And so, I pray thee, sharp to the heart.

KATHARINA:
Love give me leave awhile: think upon you,
Step forth my suit: and, in good sooth,
To leave me your leisure, Come:

Me by and by, by your bettermorrow,
: behold, and fast.

PETRUCHIO:
Was never gentleman thus grieved as he,
When I am cold in zeal to yours.
O, you cavil, widow!
But, widow,--if you be so mad--

LADY CAPULET:
Desp, how now, by this Thursday:
To-morrow, or next day,
I cannot tell you. O sir! O lord!
Who ever should have the wars but he?

Nurse:
 Thursday, sir? well, she came.

CAPULET:
What, on Thursday? to-day?

LADY CAPULET:
 Thursday, tell me.

CAPULET:
Well, she came.
But, o' Thursday, to-day?

LADY CAPULET:
We cannot.

CAPULET:
Well

CAIUS:
Why, so then our good looks
Are you in a happy disposition.

MARCIUS:
Those some six years
That seem upon us are not China born Englishman alive
But three-favour'd king and two-pex'd queen.

HERMIONE:
The king my brother is the greatest,
And all unMEN were in Mantua:

LEONTES:
He does exceed the common people's mean to be his
own king.

MOPSA:
Pray now, issue him:
What must be the news?

MARCIUS:
No news so well as one does.
What news from Mantua?

Messenger:

The king is in with the nobles:
In strict almost all of him.

LEONTES:
How now, my lord!

MOPSA:
Most gratulate!
Were he not in your debt,
We wouldly have given you all.

LEONTES:
How!

MARCIUS:
Nay, but one word.
This lady's report makes us unparent
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
How now! Give me leave, my wife!

I'll to my hear no more.

MOPSA:
Come, come, you have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me only he.

LEONTES:
What, art thou married?

Dame he not home to bed these wars?

HERMIONE:
Chame he often to visit the people?

LEONTES:
Tidings, lad, were all sore laid, knee
and anon by me sleeping.
Where is the Duke of Exeter?
You are he in the climate.

MOPSA:
He is, my lord.

LEONTES:
Do you hear how he lands and ' legs forward?

MOPSA:
I know not where; but only in delay
And in the commons' ears, and in a male tiger
To be whither'd away to, at least,
Shall say anything but were they same.

LEONTES:
How now, my lord!
If you had told the prince,
'Tis with my consent, how now,
By Him that did you make the change,
How custom and honour I do it!

HERMIONE:
Such was the matter,
That, were it not pity, I did wish
The present benefit which I did
That I might have been short to bring.

MOPSA:
Why, so thou strivest to get a crown,
And be content to live.

LEONTES:
Where is Bohemia?

p.

MOPSA:
Here in your city; I now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother, having both their country quitted
With this exchange; where both his oath
And what your oath is to save the life
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

LEONTES:
If he do us this, we ought not to lament,
But to rejoice in so them.

POLIXENES:
If they be blind, sir, and right blind,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they have stuff'd the matter out,
They will think the very nerves of state,
Their teeth clean, their teeth clean:
And say, ' sure, some pride musty chaff;
That mercy does, and men's skulls wept,
Shall walk upon us.

LEONTES:
Nine changes of the watery star;
Full of thanks and great matter.

POLIXENES:
The Hector
Of their choice stay still thus, and here I stand
By their own beauties; This weeps young;
Our sighs make one leg of your cares;
Our smiles and these our lovely colours
Cullars and our sorrow's kiss to glz;
And, for the love of gods, we sucking on her,
Culles of leadbetteries of miseries,
So come to them, that you may know
The noble tribunes were used in your common trade,
And in your just suit use I will give my dearest heart
The curse of the poor soul.

FLORIZEL:
On my soul!

Petitioners for this sore.

KING RICHARD III:
Your victory: then, whet:
And I had rather be their servant or their bed.

RICHARD III:
How now, ambitious sovereign!
Speak to me, good subject.

KING RICHARD III:
How now, my lord! what must he say?

WARWICK:
He cannot choose. I do believe
That I, his base-born son,
And the adopted heir of his unhappiness.

GEORGE:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And seized upon your sceptre.

WARWICK:
There was some danger,
That came too unterr'd, when his majesty
Did approach, and with the fearful flag,
Bade him say, my lord.

GEORGE:
The queen's will be respected with you in your drift,
And you his oath sworn duty watch.

KING RICHARD III:
But, I know, Warwick's mind.

WARWICK:
What pleasure was he made I by my queen,
To look on you and to speak of you?

QUEEN MARGARET:
No advancement, my lord, that I fear:
May it please your majesty to send me brother Rutland,
From whence you came on my brother's haar,
Where I expect your brother to visit him.

WARWICK:
And I am deceived:
As whet forth to this tragic play,
Untrone'd my practise, my mirthful mind,
Which never brook'd me with any thing,
Unto these Plantagenets.
Come, citizens: we must away.
3 KING HASTINGS:
To-morrow, or next day, you hope of your victory:
That cannot be, slight, nor ease you,
Unless you were brother king.

PRINCE EDWARD:
To-morrow, or Wednesday, lords?

RICHARD III:
To-morrow, then, I judge,--

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow, or Wednesday! to-day.

KING EDWARD IV:
Look, how our lands and hatces are windreated!

YORK:
Mine, dear lord.

KING EDWARD IV:
Call back yesterday, bid us yours, or else,
Where'er you were in, why, yours were so much:
To-morrow you will be sick for thought of it.

QUEEN MARGARET:
God save your majesty! and, with consent,
To furnish us
To some carts and bring your power back
Unto the white-path'd gnaw of the smallest:
Now, as it is, to let us march home,
And not to resist all the north-bation.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Away! let's march till we can determine
Where our argot greatness shall be:
March sadly; and, winter few moe
To prick the issue of our bodies' were got.

GLOUCESTER:
Where these events of marriage
Shall be seen! I son, I daughter,
The mother of the Lord Northumberland,
The causes of my death, and my wife,
Counting myself but the loss of thee;
I'll write again to Mantua,
Where that thy husband and my mistress
Were to be bought and my father,
And thou shalt live.

KING EDWARD IV:
So shalt thou live, and go on with me;
Where I am loath, they do fear me;
And I'll lose myself, to live.
Brother, I beseech you,
Let me remember my good thoughts,
Which you, as I love,
Will have some comfort come on me,
While yet my foes make me still.

CLIFFORD:
What, ho, my bitter husband!

SOMERSET:
'Tis pity of him.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis pity of him,
But yet his kindness is so strong as those of us.

KING EDWARD IV:
But, of your highness' mind--

GLOUCESTER:
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth
 hid at mountains from whence did I came?
Look, my lord! my cousin's face,
God knows what I see! my blood look'd upon!
And, now to London, you will tell tales
Betwixt the Duke of Buckingham and the brothers
To strew'd the sea, and
======================================== SAMPLE 172 ========================================
ARD:
He cares not for your weeping.

EXETER:
Perhaps, some, of the people's affections,
May show some pity.

MENENIUS:
O pity! I pity not his deeds!

BRUTUS:
Yet I'll pity him.

MENENIUS:
O pity! I pity!

BRUTUS:
Such pity as his pity.

SICINIUS:
Such pity as his doing,
When he did show himself thus.

BRUTUS:
But you will mar all shame to sit him down.

MENENIUS:
No, I'll not sit and weep:
If you love him, come down.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let's home.

SICINIUS:
I'll lean lean lean, lean;
This brother's son shall say
This is too much together: 'That I do not know
Whoe'er you can make my shame.

BRUTUS:
You must contrary me!

MENENIUS:
Nay, as all this chat aside,
Were you present at this relation, at any
come to it, by your firm promise,
To bring you all together: therefore, I pray you,
Be prosperous, be prosperous.

BRUTUS:
Who meets us here?

SICINIUS:
They follow.

MENENIUS:
Good morning to your royal steps be done:
WhatTidingsbury is at visit?

SICINIUS:
To wish me joy, so were they of us.

MENENIUS:
The day were broke; mine is broke.

SICINIUS:
Meantime,
What news?

Messenger:
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to Ravenspurgh, to visit
The blessed tribunes of Exeter, to report
The town of Leicester, by himself o' the queen:
You were sworn sworn sworn sworn brother,
And therefore delay not your pleasure.

SICINIUS:
Tell him, when that our joy is made,
His noble cousin gave us the next degree
To choose him a soldier: while we thought
He drew about his forces, as 'twere thought
From our great person.

COMINIUS:
He show'd us our title to the crown,
And after his person saw
him.

MENENIUS:
But what o' that?

COMINIUS:
That which, if you would be consul,
Being pent from the weighty Caucasus,
And from this country's high will.

MENENIUS:
If, by you deposed, and with the fear of
What you havefall'n upon you, you should
Be ruled upon you; and you, among the store,
In popular thanks, appear in your own
Delitty manner.

BRUTUS:
To our great sorrow we need it.

SICINIUS:
What, having him, and his most loving friends,
To be the ministers of your idolatry,
Shall bear your part, and on that go
The lodge of Leicester.

OXFORD:
I thought, at least, he could show himself,
As dangerous as a chair
On a dissension of a holy man.

SICINIUS:
If he did,
'Tis like so, which we will
Because he will not chair within our power.

MENENIUS:
So, no more:
If he do so, we ought not to deny him our request;
Or let us lose the advantage of his power,
Which we have not been instructed.

SICINIUS:
Pray, let us go.

OXFORD:

SICINIUS:
Your highness, at our request, and your kindness
Shall be able to encounter mine.

MENENIUS:
We cannot, sir;
We must proceed as we do find
Whereof the Duke of Clarence is to cut our wars.

SICINIUS:
The people will not beOur soldiers, sir,
But tread theanks and the stocks.

BRUTUS:
Where the king stands, they will not be
To comb your noddle with his own arms;
BRUTUS:
Chaplain, careless, at too forward
To prick the bowels of the nobility!

MENENIUS:
Cannot the people's love?

BRUTUS:
They will not pay for

Which he is sworn to weed and plucking all
From the judge, or thy own bastard breath,
Shall run a bastard mine. Who knows that Lodowick to be
In person to slay?

MENENIUS:
Most strange, my lord.

SICINIUS:
Beseech you, give him freedom.

BRUTUS:
I cannot tell:
If he were putting to my teeth,
He would not Bohemia.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, do notGE me: I would not do't,
If I digg'd into his government.

BRUTUS:
I pray, pretty Cominius,--

SICINIUS:
Right.

MENENIUS:
It must be so:
The gifts he looks from me are free.

BRUTUS:
You mean to Marcius!

MENENIUS:
No, to White-Friars; you must contrary.

MENENIUS:
If you were the hostess of the universal,
Your words would command a mirror hither;
But I am tied to be obedient;
We must be burnt for your loves, and you must perforce
Set down. Now, to the Capitol!
To yond
Think you will walk; and rail upon one crutch,
That Rome can make against them?

BRUTUS:
No, to White-Friars; I know by whose means
Our substitutes at home shall have the power to cross,
And we will do throughly with you.

MENENIUS:
Return unto, unruly woman!

BrUTUS:
Let's hence; good countrymen have gone,
And therefore give me leave to speak.

COMINIUS:
Well, mistress,--

Nurse:
Your mother's part, not whence you didst,
But
Your brat. Come, get you home;
Your mother is the wife of Hercules,
And you his wife's.

MENENIUS:
If for our need,
We'll speed
To help our need; but else it is impossible.

COMINIUS:
If, by your wife, and your mother's,
I could have stay'd home to keep this tidious news,
Upon access of the cheek.

MENENIUS:
Here it seems,
Yet you must bear a part which must be to't,
Where you are free.
What's o'clock?

COMINIUS:
Upon the stroke of ten.

MENENIUS:

COMINIUS:
I will sing
 tunes.

MARCIUS:
On your part
Shall I may not play the mind
To come.

COMINIUS:
Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
To be to them all and clean.

MENENIUS:
I will, my friends:
Scend me, and let's home.

COMINIUS:
Beseech you, gentle soil, adieu.

YORK:
We will.

BRUTUS:
I'ld have you do it not:
Now old desire doth cloud my joys with tears;
With eager feeding food doth choke my hopes:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This swears he, as he is an officer of the gods,
And with his noble hand I did beg
Your last embrace: and thenhand cruel death
With downright payment, show'd the needless process,
How he spake, and how he glisters
In seeming bothant, as if he were son,
And bashful Henry deposed.

MENENIUS:
O me, you are too absolute a man:
Though I am not praises the ear
For what hath long been thought, yet what was so,
So.

First Senator:
What studied torments,
To wish me joy?

VOLUMNIA:
Once more, Marcius,
When I thought Plantagenet, last where we heard
From the noise of our purpose.

MENENIUS:
So then it seems
That the oracle, the people,
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS! Bear
The seal'd-up lion o' the oracle!

BRUTUS:
What else?

Citizens:
If he had been there,
We heard from him, and you stol'n law!

MEN

First Senator:
Why looks your lord so heavily today?

Second Senator:
O, I have pass'd so fast, my lord,
That almost I will show myself a stale
Which I am not after: I will continue
The thought of my moving to a fresher clime,
When I do see the very freshest things,
And that become the keeper of my eye:
But let me be patient; I will give thee
The napkin, and the calf:
For I will calf thee, and I will calf thee;
For I will board thee to the canns,
Beseeching thee; and you will say
I am the calf.

Third Senator:
I will trust; for I will board thee,
Beseeching thee, for what art thou to say
This boy will not prove a better for the father.

Second Senator:
Be it so; go back: the thought of man
Takes such an oath: and by and by
Think you.

MENENIUS:
'Tis done, deliver'd.

First Senator:
Away! he was sworn as deeply
To prick the temper of an oath!

MENENIUS:
There stood you at the opening of the fardel, heard you were
firm like to you; for the gods,
Prespectative must be laws to us!

COMINIUS:
Sir, it is now apparent?

MENENIUS:
Most dignified,
Even for the copy of the father: one that
ires a sick man; so must he lose
All his dignity for what he may,
When he is found.

MENENIUS:
Take it up straight:
Meantime, I'll bury you to my son:
If he have those rats which I am butcher'd,
We cannot count our feasting alive;
The time will not be able to endure
What is like to be cruel.

BRUTUS:
Despised wait!
We cannot kingly in our flesh till
The shame most pleaseth.

MENENIUS:
The pleasure that some kindred of us have
I' the dear'st!

SICINIUS:
The duty that we have done to endure
Doth not the meanest.

MENENIUS:
We must all to help.

BRUTUS:
So it must be said
He is our brother: we'll best know
The noble tribunes is our dearer,
Ourself ourself ourself the dearer:
The senate
'Tis some uncles good:
That we may soon persuade
Our substitutes.

MENENIUS:
We'll surety him.

BRUTUS:
'Tis so: but a saying
He used us not o' the common people;
For by his rare example
 Upon moving them, he made
Your enemies your followers, the spiders will
Becomes more and more and fought on part and part,
Till he had no more forecast,
Being whpp'd and said,
He was your enemy.

MENENIUS:
That fellow is a noble fellow:
If I had been a man,
The thought of how he would not inform
What I was about to unfold.

BRUTUS:
Marry, Marcius, and I
UCIO:
He would not seem to me;
I am too bopp'd for some other branch
When once here he speak'd.

MENENIUS:
Pray, get you home.

BRUTUS:
Go home, you be to supper;
For you are late come supper-time
Till feast not supper-time.

MENENIUS:
Trice your clothes.

BRUTUS:
Mie, sweet my friends; I'll come dinner,
And bid them smart to-morrow.

VOLUMNIA:
In all's so.

MENENIUS:
'Tis a noble fellow.

SICINIUS:
He could never come better; he shall come in.

MENENIUS:
No, never must!

VOLUMNIA:
If you would seek tribunes for your wars,
How is it with him?

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Chop off the head of him, and leave the power
To-morrow or next day.

MENENIUS:
What is't?

SICINIUS:

The languages of your opinion, and not your words.

Nurse:

CLARENCE:
That's my husband's fault: I'll not be the man
That sets you on. Lord: I'll be husband
To drop this shame on thee, lady:
O, it is a brother's fault,
And I will speak a word. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on thee,
On cruel Montague's words.

JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now?

Nurse:
Anon!
Come, come, let's home.

KING HENRY VI:
And left I no notice, when I did see
The boy so had troubles me his father,
Who pass'd upon my daughter,
That I thought there was some grief
To bury mine intents, as swiftly
As the posts could run.

Nurse:
Have done, have done; thy fault concludes not with me:
What we have done, we are to justice,
Ourself to be revenged, and the poor thing is so,
That, revenged by the suffer of famish,
Thyself our deaths, poor thing is foolishly,
More cruel, than the Antipodes are
In Whitsun pastorals: for I know
He's apt,An oath enrolled in us.

BUCKINGHAM:
And sure, in this one,
when he be done, he will not sit
To bore his former former oath and lay anointed
Till our former time wheres:
But when we do, we must upurn him our throne,
Which being a subject fit to furnish us
Might by and by his oath find something in him.

KING HENRY VI:
I pray thee, let us be keen, rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death.
Shall feel this sight as sharp to them both?
Methinks I see it, and will be cross in talk:
And yet, to the purpose. Doth your highness smiles,
And says 'all hail!' to his presence?

DUKE OF YORK:
O happy view! as the poor cur isle,
Accustom'd to this duty!
Where is the danger now?

DUKE OF YORK:
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
The king thy brother sends you hither?

WARWICK:
For what makes you fearful?

DUKE OF YORK:
Little show to the purpose.
For what miscarries your grace's dread seat?
Your highness shall do likewise know
The unstooping firm of your power:
I know this strong right hand of justice,
And in the sworn of your highness steel'd my livery.

YORK:
I will revenge it.

KING HENRY VI:
But I cannot tell:
How heavy will it make you like this?

YORK:
Even in condition of the smallest,
For most in our justice do I give my leave,
And in condition of the smallest,
Stain'd and deft by your love.

KING HENRY VI:
O Margaret,
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with whom we were,
Among the most gracious Duke of York.

YORK:
If this prove not, then Margaret's honesty shall make
If she had been at your grace.

KING HENRY VI:
 Margaret, content thee; let me know;
The blame of that title in your title,
Be he thy own; and what she will,
Thou art poor'st, as thou art not.

WARWICK:
Thyself am I poor even now,
If not so by duty, by duty.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, what's that to thee and how
To thee and how thou art thou wounded?

YORK:
About that, that is silver prayer.

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, you confine not; for I will fight.

YORK:
I will, because I hate thee,

That are the two lead of this most grievous storm,
Which shall be the winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?

WARWICK:
Prove it, Henry. 'tis better,
The one for you troubled him: offhere's his glories,
Which were ins to qu are mighty kings,
And you should be so too valiant.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry now lives in steel, and is nothing but
The shadow of your hidden power.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him be no more than himself?

KING HENRY VI:
What duty wilt thou make to this base man?

WARWICK:
To serve all hopes from one that you are not fulfill'd:
What comfort, man? how tortures are you,
When you were wont to conquer others?

KING HENRY VI:
A holy and holy palad!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I know not where; but only to repair
To make prescription for your affairs in hand.

WARWICK:
What, at our justice he will attend
To know himself.

WESTMORELAND:
What! he will not seem to know himself.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The pleasing of him, you hear
His gracious disposition, but not a fearful
Attending but his highness.

WARWICK:
Such duty, my lord, as you mark
His humbleness to you.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Hie thee to hell! let him fear thy death:
Be it so with me, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the favour of my life,
That is not there, with too much heart.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Well, therefore it must be so with me;
Who knew of it, and hate to me;
 hurt to-day, hate to love, and hate to love.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
, some strong gage
WARWICK:
But I know not where; and therefore am not arms
To fight with foreign enemies.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
We'll debate
With no less honour than our prayers' weak
With respect.

EXETER:
Your majesty is too true: we must be proclaim'd
The contrary, which thou proclaim
In an equal volume lies
To one whom you proclaim'st thirty thousand times more worth
 than for the best.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And I'll to London,
To see these honours in possession.

Lieutenant, you lie; and to the Tower all will be:
For if you think to basest them again,
Ye need not to fear the dissembling lion.

GLOUCESTER:
I'll never sleep in quiet at a tabour
Lier than where you set your friends.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Tut, I should have been a tinker by
your dreams, or I should have been a bawd.

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow, then: give leave, gentle friends,
To come the next way with humble prayers;
And go with us; and go on with us.

KING HENRY BERKELEY:
Go, lie down, and fast;
For, brother, we'll not make a drawn
Yea, brother, do not draw our nails,
But, like the formal vice in the commonwealth,

I will sit in gold, his eye
For I will sure my souls are full of guile.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Prove me, my lord.

KING HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Shall I make my heart the right of these ill-boding dreams?
Shall I make my reasons strong with those that wish
To lie, and live to make me strong and bold in battle.

Prithee, let me have the conf leading of my love;
Be ruled, hang, and free to speak.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled, and I'll cut all of you.

First Senator:
Hie you, be ruled:
 There is no more mercy for the people's eye.

MENENIUS:
I would all were well!

First Senator:
Be ruled, and therewith.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled!

LEONTES:
I am their bed-chamber; and they shall

BRUTUS:
Whereolate, desolate, stand you so longly?

SICINIUS:
To any purpose, I warrant him.

MENENIUS:
He will not stumble, if you say you were his
will.

BRUTUS:
Wherefore, he will not stumble, if you report him any more
falling our senators by the grain.

SICINIUS:
Away! what's that to him?

MENENIUS:
But we'll make our voices to our teeth, and
our teeth clean.

BRUTUS:
You will not own it.

MENENIUS:
What is the matter, my disposition,
?

SICINIUS:
Beating, brow! why strew'st thou, fellow?

MENENIUS:
If ever he will shed no more

BRUTUS:
If that be not so, then all too base
The integrity of the tribunes body.

MENENIUS:
Has he such a heart as yours,
That thus affect'st?

BRUTUS:
He's mad.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let him hear himself.

BRUTUS:
Let him marcius,

We need his remedies.

MENENIUS:
If he be Menatic, 'twould need we need
the cornks and money.

Away!

MENENIUS:
What, need he?

BRUTUS:
Come, let him go.

MENENIUS:
Not possible:
The nobles in great Bohemia are in arm.

BRUTUS:
You are marvellous forward.

MENENIUS:
O that you are so lean, that you are malapert:
Beseeching, sir, I would they love and

Their hate is bruising to the ears.

BRUTUS:
Pray you, let's hear.

MENENIUS:
Now be they come.

BRUTUS:
Be ruled by me.

SICINIUS:
For you, the people
Do right to this deed, and therefore, Angelo,
Who all the faults he made,
I known to Marcius, are as interpreters
Of hostile strokes and mortal-staring war,
To Marcius is worthy of present death.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled by him.

BRUTUS:
Farewell, hear these articles.

SICINIUS:
Go home, be home;
We'll to dinner, nay, and wedding.

MENENIUS:

SICINIUS:
Beseech you, hear them speak, and tell them what
We say.

BRUTUS:
We know not how to tell you these known.

SICINIUS:
Yet had not we determined he should win our purpose,
If he could put his power to be his house within his
 adopted heir and come from hisToo.

BRUTUS:
'Tis deceived;
We will not be undone:
Because, were he but the one of us,
Being ever spright, he had been used
In the house of Corioli, by jest,
With humble and familiar courtesy.

MENENIUS:
But, were he more angry for our noble purpose
Than you of all the people,
Imagine how he refell'd our Marcius
When he did take the world by the house,
 whence 'tis derived.

More than the infant that is born,
I cannot tell: for what unaccustom'd cause
Than when I did see my lord in a dream,
Who told me, he would not come down,
But I, with blowing hisembs in his smoking blood,
Pew'd him up in his smoking blood:
That jade hath not been many hours,
In any time, yet his royal person
Did not so set his diadem upon his lip
That birds should sing and sound and sound and wise;
Therefore, at the mercy of his majesty,
He capers nimbly; and so I mean,
An't please him to come down.

BENVOLIO:
O,, death, shall not this speech be spoke with?
Shall we desire to quaked and entreat his majesty
To yield our body to the will of Rome?
O, no! I respected in that I respected in him.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who set'st my bawdy tongue on my head
In the base tongue of Angelo?
I am too wise to put our dibble in.

BENVOLIO:
Be ruled:
When one part of his majesty
Hath Death art thou o'er-thrown, then thou shalt not
do't to hell.

ROMEO:
O, then,
If he would be content to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers, and
Those of whom he is,
Might stop our countryman!

BENVOLIO:
The people in the street cry Romeo?

ROMEO:
O, he is of great authority.

BENVOLIO:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He's the
more proud that is not Bohemia.

BENVOLIO:
He is not content:
For our compliments are many things that make him good:
We have not the forges hid, but
The pride of one another, the enemy to
the people's pleied and one against the plebeii.

ROMEO:
The mightiest of this were peril,
If that were at home.

BENVOLIO:
The people in the street cry Romeo?

ROMEO:
Most of them are:
Without his roese and he hide'd;
For emulation now cries out his ease.

BENVOLIO:
Nature teaches beasts to know.

ROMEO:
More than his lord's life, what a more
he is, that makes thee more.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
That is another noble memory fault
Which thou should eject in society.

ROMEO:
Come, believe
How you are made to endure; and, if so,
In soothing them shall you make
With kissing sorrow, as being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I will't please you,
In sign of what you are willing; and, if
More have you will not here, lament;
If not, use will Bianca and I
 mean these frowns.

BENVOLIO:

ROMEO:

As if he were all as dear as I
In all his dress'd robes:
Without your bruising smote, an she agree,
So she express himself, to say I love.

BENVOLIO:
Well, say, my lord.

ROMEO:
She cannot choose but branch now.

BENVOLIO:
She shall not, I hear.

ROMEO:
Prithee, let's hear.

BENVOLIO:
Who, that haply will not yield to our complots?

ROMEO:
Thou art not the flower of courtesy,
If your poor father will be contented

BENVOLIO:
I cannot but look on,
And cannot tongue me told off.

ROMEO:
She may but call them down, by one being slain,
I cannot imagine what I can,
But fire, to be to be to my dug- down,
With that my death-bed is barren and my poor head's due,
Even in the form of death.

As she in harvest. Were I a gentleman,
Then were the best that day,
By this crystal scales let my body find
This dead-killing news:
Besides, she came from

And how she gallopsed my years,
The time every day better:
These wars determine of me what they can,
She determines an argosity,
That, with the consent of supreme law,
Was fast belock'd in extremity.

EDWARD:
I think she'll sooner or more an argosy
Than let former grudges pass.

RICHARD:
That's better, sir, it must be so.

EDWARD:
Thou chidest me over the part which I am,
In this opinion of mine.

MONTAGUE:
Now I am a woman, by your good report,
What says your highness to my just demand?

RICHARD:
The doubt, I fear,--

 not all uncles there,--I mean no good den,--
--I'll rather show myself a tyrant
Than a poor painted swain asleep.

YORK:
What says your majesty?

EDWARD:
I cannot show myself a show,
For I will be no more judged
Than one so nigh. ladies and children are slain
In rescuing me to the grave;
And all my blame is due to show.
Shall I show my face, and make my leg to speak,
And when I look'd upon the face of Henry,
'When was I match'd, was when
I did see'd your grace: then again, methought,
I heard your fearful tale pronounced,
'When he said, and vauntingly,
Bade me stand aloof: now he is come,
Splitting your bow of him.

YORK:
That is most certain, that I know:
That is, that we may digest our complices.

Messenger:
Such is the indictment of your majesty,
Which finds easy will to know.

YORK:
His majesty's will be full of this;
For every part of his majesty
Lives but to command.

YORK:
I know by his mind
He will not be slack: nay, if he show us
our strange sightst, we'll show him a kind of mercy.

 OF those that feed upon this seeming he
cannot choose.

Second Servant:
And would he not stumble?

PETER:
Where I should thou ride?

Servant:
Where I should thou ride?

BUSHY:
Whilst I, with those that feed upon thee,
Should be taught by my courses,
From the one another, to be thine.

CLEOMENES:
The other,
That brought you forth this female bastard,
Whom with mildness and with a disposition
More fit to be or little,
Than was your former strength.

PAULINA:
Speak, good queen,--

EMILIA:
Dost thou teach pardon to destroy?

PAULINA:
No, good queen;
The word is short, but as she is an adulteress.

LEONTES:
He cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Since when I am bigger I need my bones
To come to hear and see, I am too mean a person
To def demand what 'tis.

YORK:
Why, so my sweetly father then,
When I am forth, that would disinherit me:
He, but I will do so, is too cruel a maw.

PAULINA:
He'll fling it in your highness, like a frantic man.

LEONTES:
No, good Paulina, to be so bold as our nails,
Shall bear equally of his teeth,--
Since every scope by stone was sharp, and every scope by false,
Now peised in the shadow of his soul.

PAULINA:
So then you hope of pardon from LordGremio,
Who set you on to do this deed?

LEONTES:
What, had he been!

PAULINA:
I pray now, call him.
Withdraw yourselves.
I thought his happy life had been as continent,
How he might have be thereat home,
Since there is more pain in't than with parting heaven.
Feed not thy sovereign.

LEONTES:
Father of blunt thought,
Which here comes into my food,ison.
How he glisters and his kind of son,
and how he smiles, and does the widow mark
Herself cheque of blood more than himself?

If he may help, design it quickly.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
So please you, let me know this fault:
No, by taking angry note,
My brother's fault is not accidental, but in
the orb,--the society: one thing more, two, to two,
 and two, as they are, behold'd
In the business, and most assured
By his himself, by our succession,
In every scope, as he stands,--

LEONTES:
O, so, my heart!

PAULINA:
Do not you fear:
I see, I hear!
I see! what a jot at home!

LEONTES:
Do not see:
We must confer, but are you sure
Of my creditors and the language's deliverance
To a lie and use. This do I beg your grace,
As recompense of my fortune, to visit
Where I am loath: but farewell.
Would I were dead!

LEONTES:
Thou wouldst be again to have my daughter's blessing!

PAULINA:
Or, if thou'lt, that I were here,
If 'gainst any grace.

LEONTES:
No.

PAULINA:
Either forbear, or resolve me not:
I am content with this flight of France,
Which can no better by or I can devise,
More than I thought, to ambitious York.

LEONTES:
He designs the stealth of great kings.

PAULINA:

I do not like it:
The stealth I have,
My most assured my soul
The happy disposition of my queen's allies
Cry mercy, when 'twixt heaven and earth
Might e'er conditions:
But that we did,
That we did, we did, it will so.

LEONTES:
That false
faced fellow, that did betray our lord,
The resignation of the two kings.

PAULINA:
That the queen's kindred are the subjects now,
And have an old sceptre of her proud sceptre,
That, were she as virtuous, as she is,
I'ld have heard of ruthless Clifford's rigour.

LEONTES:
He is in the base, fool so base his mirth
To kiss the princes' feet, that he treads
As while he knit oaths:
MOPSA:
My noble liege, I envy not thy glory
To what I can; am I not my lawful king?
If not, be any other name?

LEONTES:
Why, that is not this King's brother,
As from unparted many years.

LEONTES:
He is, my lord.

HERMIONE:
By my sceptre, I cannot say
What 'twere: but from my heart,
And from my soul too;
But from my soul too:
Clarence is his name; and more of his kind
Than kings, by man and woman.

LEONTES:
He would not seem to me, I warrant
But I have been more mild:
When I was removed, he let me say
What noble man art thou, and I cannot tell;
But I will be sworn:
Upon my life, my brother's coat,
And on my knee I kiss heffing.

LEONTES:
Sweet gentleman! the lean abhorred monster.
See, ruthless my lord!
Thou dotard! thou art Amazon;
Who of name,
Who late hath scorn'd you all of me,
And made you stoop! you gods!

LEONTES:

Or what?
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
Ere stay behind this business.
Sir, get you gone: I will follow you.

LEONTES:

To maintain thine oath and thy oath:
We'll not budge unless thee have patience.

During his power.

Not only his friend, but himself.

And we'll meet more nobly.

We'll put you to your service.

That whatsoever branch of your sceptre's right
Can branch unto the most gracious throne?
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all.
And you, my brave father, Montague,

And through him I boldly am dispatch'd
With no more contempt than the vice
That thou expect'st not by your house;
And therefore hence, I thank thee,

For I am prepared to strike and gallose thee.

Nay, rather, gentle Earl, be second to me:
Sweet York, and thou drink'st good for me.

Seal up the mouth of thine eye for that which thou revenge'st
To banish'd him that jests in our flesh.

If I were thy angry, I would have been
The happy that thou didst procure.

KING HENRY VI:
Hadst thou been be that prince by the battles and
That did usurp the back of Henry,
How he might have fought so long.

YORK:
No, I'll not bear these braves to-day,
To show them things amiss in me.

KING HENRY VI:
How they call these
foldings, they kiss one another, the third,
The allgher heart that we have:
Set them dress'd custom, proud Plantagenet,
And never made me tremble.

YORK:
Be patient, man; thou mayst not speak too much:
Be patient, wretched man, and I'll speak more
Than what thou speak'st.

KING HENRY VI:
Titus Lartius, thou torment'st me ere I was born.

LARTIUS:
Why, therefore art thou mad, and altogether wrong?

WARWICK:
What's right, and therefore art thou mad?

WARWICK:
If, by heaven, I know it,
Thou mayst be so; but, since it is not right,

Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
Aufidius got off.

But had he been in the mind of Richard,
Who did usurp the back of Montague,
Then smooth he fault of virtue,

As most pronounced, him to the death.

Because their highness is no jot at all
Like to the faults of unquietised, when he show
Like the citizens, when he stamp'd,

And is not the king's name,
Nor no other name than either?

To be oracle, to bring the rest.

Your majesty's will be taken;
And this your son, with unstomach'd thoughts,
To be oracle, by your side.

WARWICK:
Give me your jewels: I'll put up my iron dagger,
And put on iron dagger-work.


YORK:
I took him;
Made him joint-work for all the chests in Corioli,
And all the gold and all his trim belonging
Did lace the steel and stone with a bribe,
To shrink the volume of idle hours
Even ere one would set up a hundred.

RICHARD:
He cannot live by looking on you.

YORK:
Methinks he looks as though he were a king.

WARWICK:
To rise by his throne, and where kings are kings,
Were he to chide the stones of the foresaid prunes;
And what are they that stand under his metre?

Ay, pilgrimable;
But what are you, sir?

WARWICK:
To crown him, even thout.

The last, to make a Dauphin and a queen.

The words of our duty, and our doubts,
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.

I'll bear thee company.

YORK:
Nine! Come, bring forth twenty of these rats.

RICHARD:
Sweet father, you wot that I am not of your children
To be the headman to these rats.

WARWICK:
Think you my ruth and your high will be satisfied?

YORK:
That loss of those three by two gives me leave.

KING HENRY VI:

Great uncle York, let my years serve me excuse
Why I did not service that so my grief.

YORK:
He shall not, be patient.

GEORGE:
We'll fit thee to our turn,
Where he shall no more be loath to our turn.

But when I was a king, and by him I was sworn,
That only claim by proof and report
The happy branch of ungrowing evil deeds.

Then he was enemies to my sweet love;
But when I was a king, he was not so my enemy.

And when I was anointed king,

Hence with her vices, with these black-s loving-incensed

Dear, so she will, I pray.

FLORIZEL:
If he do me right, 'twas pity.

CULTIS:
To think I am he you, 'tis better than I,
If you be not mad, which is some comfort.
But where is he, that cruel child-killer?

FLORIZEL:
Being pent from liberty, as 'twere
Where'ld thou mean'st, such a widow
As you to wail when I did see him. I
would he were returned'd that I respect.
Marry, it is pity.

Be ruled by me; forget not
that I pity Henry's misery,
For I tell you he is not your spring,
But issue forthwithal:'
Live, and I would ere I were dead.

PERDITA:
I will live, and leave you: pray, awake.

Clown:
And I pray thee, awake, or else:
But if so, by heaven, I cannot appease thee.

AUTOLYCUS:
I cannot but call thee brother then.

Clown:
Ay, and have been still my midwife to my soul,
Since sometime evil deeds of fatal importance
In progress of hostile was heard of!

FLORIZEL:
Yet had he died that day, my lord;
For testimony of that t' other death
Betake not his death nor banish'd him, but that
Which peril, to weed my vice forth of kin,
I mean but his life.

FLORIZEL:
Sweet father, the name of mercy,
What dangers, by hanging thee out
In accursed by his enemies,
That did but kill my body
And that the strong and swelling evil
Of the poor world's ransom,
Did ever so besc me.

FLORIZEL:
I cannot tell:
The writing posterns are made
Both print and house-cases twenty thousand times
My body's parting is the equal of my joy:
So please you, let me know't.
I do not know: but, if ever any grubber knew
The thing I have, 'tis by them.

Let me be sworn: on every oath,
That till all the heaven together
Had no more double or limit to my prayers!

CLEOMENES:
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

QUEEN MARGARET:
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

EDWARD:
No, by my wife, but that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled;
And, in falling, poor Clarence did but see,
And wrathful fortune gave me leave to escape.

RICHARD:
That day's my, the lord'st.

EDWARD:
'Tis done, my lord.

YORK:
'Tis done:
My lords, when we were chosen
He straight shall post to Ravenspurgh,
To offer service to the Duke of Exeter,
And perform a saint-like sorrow:
Tyrants themselves wept when he said,
And crossly was his prayers to the gods.

EDWARD:
O, bear him my shame! he used us scorn,
Being pent to scorn, and baited
Of modesties; then straight wept,
And show'd unto his majesty.

YORK:
His glories am I glories to report to this,
His oath enrolled in the Nature of him;
That had no more contempt to conceal our love
Than so his enemies have.

WARWICK:
He swore oaths to us that he had not done us.

YORK:
And yet the king not only knows how we can.

WARWICK:
And witnesses of his disposition,
Beating the bitter flag, and quickly jump'd down the other
On his oath and what beside his oath,
That Henry had no more than might.

KING HENRY VI:
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Reseal'd the kingly lion in the malmsey.

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and in such a case the gods will not be good to us.

YORK:
Thou art sworn my king to revenge
On you to pluck him down.

KING HENRY VI:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I thank thee not;
For we will issue out again,
To a determined scope.Meantime,
Once more to issue, or piece with thee;
I mean not how to make our bodies
In black or in the heart.

YORK:
Shall I be heard?

CLIFFORD:
Who is't that goes with me?

QUEEN MARGARET:
The Duke of York.

YORK:
How he means to come to't?

CLIFFORD:
He standsAs chairless as the cloak of he
When he were little expected of our way.

YORK:
ThenShow no more but he does jest,
And is not warm enough to be strange.

CLIFFORD:
What other dances he of this?

YORK:
Raphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching the gentle hind of a thorny wood
Upon the grassy Caucasus out of Caucasus.

RAMIS:
My lord?

YORK:
Meth I had rather be his servant in my mistress,
Than sway with him in a male tiger.

YORK:
If your revengeful heart cannot brook the
pity of the beast, it must be
Ere eating and drinking hard.

Clown:
Think you but I am hungry for revenge?

ARCHWICK:
Too it is, that e'er I did see my death;
And yet the deep divines all beside
Mine.

Upon you and your behests;
Step forth your ranks; these--

He is their god: as I insinuate,
Each part to his glory, by giving him our commission
To the gods ofOur own our powers, our powers,
Our soldiers','d, and all 'gainst us.

BRUTUS:
Tell him the name of Marcius:
Merely, at least, and in as cunning
To us to endure friends, to please
With known and approved friend, as we to be
In common praise, as thus he is
Shows us but one thing that he is not used
Without our tricks: when he's removed,
Let 't not be doubted
We shall have some among us; and, if
He give us our own again, 'tis by
Our will.

First Senator:
The gods be good to us!

MENENIUS:
They do us grace.

MENENIUS:

We'll see our Rome embraced with our will.

BRUTUS:
And be you concul'd with the people,
As he is beloved and loves!

MENENIUS:
If he were our king,
We would esteem him worth a thousand crowns
In Rome, and desire strong statutes
To make our Rome about him.


CORIOLANUS:
There is no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

MENENIUS:
If he could,
We'll esteem him worth a thousand crowns.

Therefore, on:
Yet I wish, Marcius,--
I mean not Marcius!
Yet, were Marcius,
A Marcius, a Marcius poor grain or what
This present death day had laid,
He had not used it.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us retire:
Let them come.

CORIOLANUS:
Go, get you home; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell, be trusty. Now, our substitutes

And raise his kingdom to 'Double or at least,

And serves it to call King Polixenes.
O, what a beast was I to chat with you
When I did see the prince: and look'd you
To make the jest, and that you did not mind
To be the jacks fair within your power.

CAMILLO:
You did not show them any courtesy, when the queen,
Your sisterly father York and I
love the idle thine enemy:
O, I think they will all come down in some fashion,
More than the infant that is born.

Where dwellest you, I can tell you, hear,
And that my daughters fair stars were plotted,
To cross to some villontory:
Methinks these told down this were not incensed,

Their issue was to put a thousand times his person,
Of an unaccustom'd spirit, and still winter
In storm perpetual. Now, the oracle is fulfilled,
Is that the queen is spotless?

FLORIZEL:
She is, the king's, and has the oracle.

And is this true, too, I'll grant her,
If I will be obedient; and, if she dares,
We'll give her thanks, for giving you more moths.

Pray, let us hear these tell-tale women

Who Bona is nearest to my heart,
And therefore I'll idle, serve veil'd this disguise.

Besides, if the oracle were so rich,
As I am content, I would wish
This youth should sooner found than me,
Or that young play'd the hide of shame,
That ripe in the fortune of these our years

Thanks, good Camillo, for thy care and secrecy:
As sure as I play the oracle,

But by and by freely give my daughter freedom.

Not having my country for length.

While I did live to see the tender Clarence open,
From whence came the brecer.

Sweet brother, by my soul, thou know'st
Thy grief's cloak is due to me. Come, gentle gentle mortal,
Let's home. Is my son dead? the worst?
Condemned cousin, you would not stay the while
You cried 'Courage!' you should not say
How sweet a peevish boy or so; so were fit
To bid us dead that which they supposed
To be or to be buried, by your coming field.

But not with the weighty mind, that he is

Then, since what is that to him?

Say, Marcius, art thou sure of this?

We'll joint, Marcius; worthy Marcius is

O, he is grown most kind of late,
Such a nature, his disposition, and possess'd
By something wildly more than himself,
That led his hateful luxury
To unloose any thing in Rome,
and desire every Marcius
To prick the gods of soldiers.

That we may arm us to encounter him.

For being more rash in ladies' minds,
Shuts up my power, and MEASURE.

And therefore law shall justly know
What I can urge against the people.

For that I hate: but as I am bigger,

To hold all unmade-Slewalled thoughts, when given

That reigns without distinction.

As the proud man is.

That had not we revenge'd thee; and am I
That honourable a man?

And I'll back to Rome, and send
Defiance to the senate.

BRUTUS:
I'll make them back again:
If Marcius should be our king,
We need not to wait and stay
To him.

If he hear our counsel,
We'll give him our jewels.

For some strong purpose.

And presently will post

BRUTUS:
You have made good work, you and you have your

To cross the seaside.

SICINIUS:
Why, Marcius,
Why, this Marcius is of heavier kind than himself,
Even of the heavier, are you
In our Coriolanus?

BRUTUS:
If, by you be his lip, and eyes under his arm,
First the gods look down and see him famous; but
As you are a gentleman, where is your arm,
And I am no worse than my name;
Or those thoughts, of Marcius,
Which never laugh till now:
COMINIUS:
Look, Marcius!

MARCIUS:
He looks
As if you were present.

SICINIUS:
BRUTUS:
I would he had been content to
be a consul!

BRUTUS:
Would he were content to resign his crown after
If something your will ear against are prayers
derived from your will,
That you might still be praying.

MENENIUS:
If he do not pray for your love to me,
We ought not to deny him.

SICINIUS:
If he do me half, 'twixt heaven and earth;
That one part of your chiefest duty is
To save the people's welfare.

BRUTUS:
You must think to us.

SICINIUS:
That's the way.

Our soldiers', he is gone to France:
Those powers which we have left
 are our stateabouts, but we will

BRUTUS:
If, as he does, I will be his fellow
And not his fellow: any thing possible.

SICINIUS:
You will be sworn to his integrity and take all
Your oaths; and, if he show us any thing
besides his singularity, you shall not
do't: go to us to him.

BRUTUS:
We'll leave you.

A graceless child out of the world,
Young, but yet your daughter marook

Your eye's eyes are not the ignorant

Your brows are blacker;

SICINIUS:
Yet had not we determined he should be consul,
Because he had rather of the people than
To have him soointed: yet had he been tried,
Because he could put us in disadvantage,
Which we think to be so muddy,
From our faults, to be so chaste,

'Twas nothing but he,
And yet his son, who slew him.

CLIFFORD:
That's no matter, my lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Wish'st thou pity those I talk of,
Which contradicts my accusation
And makes thee Duke of Clarence: yet as we hear thou speak'st,
We hear, and see how he requites me,
And I will resign my gage. My Lord of Clarence, how he
Must help in this monarchy, as thou help'st!

CLIFFORD:
What! I cannot help it now:
By all the sceptres, as 'twere all,
That reigns as kings.

POLIXENES:
O my poor father!
When I did see him and I repose,
I know not what I am: but he

WARWICK:
Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you his burial-day.

HERMIONE:

Now, my wounds become them.

You highly have lace'd my coining to your heart,
And I with pale-faced by your general.

POLIXENES:
O, I had rather had a heart

O happy labour, my masters! my wounds become them.

MENENIUS:
Farewell, noble lords.

WARWICK:
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.

KING HENRY VI:
I had rather have him and I am alike,
Not fearing the separated councils of the people,
To be so bated them further trial'd on me:
But I have heard that fearful commenting
Put leaden servitor to his fortune,
Unto the spur of great Bolingbroke.
'Tis he that made us all, as some would seem to do,
Says that we were fit to stand and put our fear's tale,
Unto the citizens.

MENENIUS:
'Tis he that made us rich, and his fame is as true
As any proud man may.

WARWICK:
Believe me, this is true.

Messenger:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for this:
If you'll take it on you to say
Commit me to the people and abide, go off
To entertain them to the humour of your highness,
For 'tis all as easy broke as to make
I cannot now to say.

MENENIUS:
The king!

RICHARD:
What else? what must he say?

Messenger:
He cannot disinherit me:
Because, by the armour of our right,
He cannot lie and is not furnish'd like a child.

MENENIUS:
Because I am like you,
Your children were destined to court.

EXETER:
But you, my son, will not be king
Till our coronation:
You should not be, have been so bared,
But by the duty of your majesty:
To-morrow
Shall we be divided?

Messenger:
And I send my brother Clarence to your grace:
I thought it were a happy flight
To learn the cause of this bright-shining throne
From whence 'tis derived.

SOMERSET:

I know not else: how to-morrow
You'll hap to-day, and give
A noble memory! Yet tell me not,
Why sing I now! ha, opposed!

What day is this, of what disposition,
Which dances feated my rapt heart
In jatement to thorny weeds?

That might without the very pink of some,
That might wail the reply of such a grief,
Yet the presence of the mind of the needer.

To hold his disposition, but with his glories
To undeck the dust that he tread'd to,
And very his merit.

For hand, body, were at odds
To one seven and seven slaves;
Would he not stumble?

LUCIO:
O, belike, what a cruel father's he!
As fast as t'Twixt heaven and earth.

ISABELLA:
As many hours, Marcius,
Come between us.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
On thy rocky bosom: thousand waiting on thee;
In half an hour, Marcius is with death
Of a cruel death.

ISABELLA:
This is his lordship's pleasure,
'Tis all as dangerous.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
A noble fellow is this same,
As very wise and humble:
If he be not in bed to-night,
Shall his garments fit to make all senses
Tremble at his heels.

Provost:
Even modest one,
If he be blind,
Because he's as ignorant in virtue,

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
He's mad.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
So lies his disposition
ToBear his body in a mistress' mind.

Provost:
Hail your mistress! he deserved his life.
But you his death-bedbed is no more
Than what you are.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You might have kept your chair, you would not have been so
The chair you have been, I have been so bawd--

Provost:
So you have: then I'll tarry till my son come;
that is, not the duke much more cruel for the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He so troubles him,
'Tis by false modesty.

Provost:
Who should so bescreen'd beua,
That in the very siege of his law find
This hidden power, as in a house
Did spy and steal from the bosom of the same
Where he did I mean to take the beggar's mercy?

ANGELO:
Such it is.

Provost:
Show it your naked eyes, and your face
To the determination of Master Froth:
Froth, and let the devil look down,
And this soft world look to behold upon.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Alas, poor friar! this unlook'd looking-for sport,
and vengeance in your vouch!

ESCALUS:
My lord, I know, and I love it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love talks with better goth, and knowledge with
dearer will.

ESCALUS:
And better, then, come.

ANGELO:
And then,--
Shall satisfy your father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Without more contempt,
When he does the thing he requested,
You must not own it.

ESCALUS:
We'll do it,
And be so no offence to him.

ANGELO:
I think he'll be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: sure the man
isarse, but not soars ere I can hear him speak.

And you no more must be so too,
For, were he, bridegreed on your feast,

But if your highness would fly from us,

BRUTUS:
We'll tarry till he comes to his lecture,
Where our among can attend him.

MENENIUS:

SICINIUS:
From Rome.

MENENIUS:
You will not own it.

SICINIUS:
 Back, here come Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
Go, you highness, get you home; be trusty, and go about with

COMINIUS:
Tread not on him. Masters all, be strong;
We'll sure him.

MENENIUS:
Lords, he is strong and strong as o' the people.

SICINIUS:
Will't please your highness to assign me your narest

The people will give my noble hand,
And do't your worship.

Which you to preserve is of no greater kindred
Than you of sons to's.

IA:

Why, therefore you speak unskilfully:
Pardon me, sweet madam. By your patience,
If you report him truly, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.

LEONTES:
Be ruled by him.

POLIXENES:
Marry, and by my most gracious mother!

EMILIA:
So, she is your wife's champion.

LEONTES:
If I may counsel you, some woful,
I know not where; but where is your mother?

EMILIA:
Where, Camillo, thou mean'st not.

EMILIA:
A blessed labour, indeed, and one that were of fourscore pounds
To chide the gods so high.

LEONTES:
Brags of his authority,
His oath enrolled in the nothing
Of this true which they did to-day.

First Lord:
I know his oath is of no moment,
More than his or yours, I desire.

LEONTES:
Who brought it?

EMILIA:
The ship, sir, I know.

LEONTES:
The lad,
A'?

EMILIA:
AOne that was a poor groom died on't;
The other holp to make you good so like him.

LEONTES:
What holp? what holp?

EMILIA:
The ship, sir,
I know.

LEONTES:
No, but he must die to-day:
What holp?

EMILIA:
When, with his lip and eyes, he kiss'd the gods
In an equal force.

LEONTES:
That's the cavil of a great lord's hate:
He is the god of my idolatry,
and I an't like him.

PAULINA:
He is gone to bed,
and, behold me, here.
I shall behold him and come too unprovided.
I will not trust the heaven with words and threats
To press among the popular throngs even to the state,
To cross the most holy churchyard.

LEONTES:
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Teth toil, rather with looks, smooth looks,
I see his glory like an angry ape.

PAULINA:
So it must be so. Art going?

EMILIA:
Yes, an't like you.

LEONTES:
I will not trust:
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
The odds for high and low's alike.

PAULINA:
My lord, you do me double wrong,
To this day's journey.

LEONTES:
I am too sudden: believe me, sir,
To think your former state a happy dream;
And, if you be not so, what I was,
I warrant, I'll never be for what I can the gods look
Against us.

LEONTES:
What our lord?

EMILIA:
A.

LEONTES:
He cannot choose.

PAULINA:
By my lord?

EMILIA:
'Tis but his state by law and asleep,
He cannot choose but branch now. Since,
You cannot tell how to lay one in place,
Imagine I would were a branch-work,
Some one of the poor infinite sceptres
That use their hands at once
To root out themselves, but that perform the branch now
Without that leaves branch: therefore in good
faith, a lord,
Who from the seedness the root is guilty
Of this plant, and his leaves show me his
To faithful service, and perform the rite of humility.

LEONTES:
You know the power, I hear, and I can give mine
To curse the offenders that do't.

PAULINA:
Could all but learn from whence his sin is done?
'Tis by no means broken: for when I see
These forces are attended'd, and his highness
Wrench awe from fools and artell. What think you, lords?
Grace me not; I speak as my cause.

LEONTES:
To me, mistress!

PAULINA:
No more of this. What thought of him,
But of this most gracious liege,--
He was
======================================== SAMPLE 201 ========================================
illi'd and unpleasing.--Came he not home to-night?

None:
Yes, with such a case as mine a wife.

Shepherd:
O, he is a devil, the fount that makes himself,
And will not suffer the punishment:
The curses he have, the tortures he shall.

Clown:
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood?
The ruthless mansion of the feast:
O, by the house of Montague walls!
O, this is All-A day's sacrifice,
The son of young Mars, by the mere request of
To caparison; his daughter meanly,
And all the day worse, to the death.

Clown:
Comfort, my soul! she that makes dainty,
She attended not thy father nor none of me;
The house of Wolves and bears, Rivers well perfumed,
Are smother'd in the suburbs;
In every borough as we stood up about,
There were crept into the dirt an hour,
And every hour was call'd for, by the suppliants.

Clown:
We stood up about the corn, boy; boy.

AUTOLYCUS:
That fellow is a poor fellow,
Whose father bears the title of a slave,
His cruel striking, and disinherited.

Clown:
Comfort, good comfort! We must all come down.

AUTOLYCUS:
I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I come too late.

Clown:
You shall not come too late: either you must come to me,
And come too late by and by.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, were it not this mockery,
Since you had such a father to many years,
To cross I thought it fittingly to divorce myself,
By just computation of hours, and hours,
Shortly since, were devised,
My father dead, that we did talk of,
And that the good man might come to me;
So that in the base court he is dead.

Clown:
That's a foolish observation:
O, to combine one thing, and 'twere done,
And that is, to be murder'd by the ear.
I done this for some stair-work:
To the concupiscible heart
My father named me Autolycus; who had but two
To raise my old father to the present sickness
When he did see my son, as then the people's officer
Did curse the poor thing he did me;
He was an adulteress; being pent-pity
The sun not yet his majesty
The present death: but to the last,
Went revenge me to the cause and come;
Till, being hated, and myself must vouch,
Thyself, being hated, appear'd the same
We did, appear'd to us.

Clown:
We will, my lord.

AUTOLYCUS:
The duty that I owe to your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet child:
I seal upon't.

Clown:
It is my charge to keep the court'sy:
Me to keep the courty. Come; I'll
March to the it and perform.

AUTOLYCUS:
The duty that I owe to your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet child.

Clown:
Me too, let me be ignorant,
And in myself no duty should do myself:
The matter, good sir, is mine.

AUTOLYCUS:
Pray, Master, get you home; I will follow you.

Clown:
We must not make a rash enmity,
Setting a yielding,.

AUTOLYCUS:
If what thou do'st know
I know it; yet let me have
Some remorse or comes from him.

Clown:
Are there no manners left among maids?

MOPSA:
Are there not milking-time, when you were suppose
You should be the father of a silly lady,
That were your former all, as some would seem to be,
Properly some mean-born gentleman might have found you here:
Look, sir! here comes a man;
A child, I wonder.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, this is a poor knot, you know:
This young sir, I know, and believe it.

Clown:
Speak it, and say, 'tis a knot indeed, but
I cannot do it; yet, to the knot he

TRANIO:
By the ground, I dare not say so.

GREMIO:
O, my mistone! why do you say you must
ink in me? I will say you may,
and I will be there when I say you never.

TRANIO:
Why, 'twas e'er I did see my country.
I must be patient till the next man come;
The next where I must be, must be.

TRANIO:
Do not you say you will not go to bed,
 waking, insulting o' the feast:
Lie, post to my father's; where I should,
Though I am content to be alone,
but that I shall not be a guest for such friends.

LUCENTIO:
O, sir, you must report to the gentlemen in great matter;
For examine of thought, I had as lief
see a gentleman.

PETRUCHIO:
Their very worshipful:
Meats, that I may turn the word,
and in the matter, where he began,
He follow'd me on his pleasure.

Which I am sworn to weed and pluckback'd.

TRANIO:

TRANIO:
No, to be blunt, but to gratulate.

BAPTISTA:

BIONDELLO:
Tranio, good sooth, because I am not general.

TRANIO:
Why, therefore 'tis thus:--
I, that art thus bold in the execution,
, flatterers; that lie full or reckless,
I cannot tell you.

BAPTISTA:
All faults upon you.

GREMIO:
All faults upon me, when I know,
I am thus resolved: on your hate,
And so, to cut off those off that you have:
Tranio, till we were chosen,
He straight declined, his adopted heir;
I am tied to be obedient;
Doubt not but his natural qualities
Lain all weathers.

You, that know no which way to stand?

BAPTISTA:
Are you sworn to the people's love?

TRANIO:

And there I stood, to seeThose happy years
Which I have brought you.

PETRUCHIO:
And turns the hate to one that need the bark.

BAPTISTA:

Better it were a brother died at once.

PETRUCHIO:
What then?

TRANIO:
More of him anon.

BAPTISTA:
Why, that is brother?

TRANIO:
More of him anon.

BAPTISTA:
Why, you link to me; your rough rude line
Mangles true computation of the wisdom of your majesty;
And you use your brother's advantage and your jealousies
To cram a pawn lion in the equal of your joy.
I do bend my knee with thine;
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
I'llound to 'scape their familiarity,

Of nothing else, might have seen ye'ld.

Second Servant:
But this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your children not shower'd, he's sure my
heart wept.

PAGE:
Well, but he was too raw,
Which sixteen years of malice should yield him leave
To Bolingbroke.

EMILIA:
If I revolt, 'twenty have left my dearest heart
To stew these wars.

PAGE:
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For, as the main news we heard
Sir Henry, 'tis Henry and the Earl of Wiltshire;
For trust not simple Henry nor the queen's,
We could hear no news.

KING HENRY VI:
What news of this? what news,
From France? and that news with eyes
So wildly?

EMILIA:
None, our news so well purged.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, what then?

EMILIA:
Your sorrow is worth so much,
That you might well enjoy it some while some part some unburnt
 fortnight keeps your doing: nay,
 sometimes,
Like to a sepulchre, where he is,
Like to a tenement or pelting farm,
Then have I known too long.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So many years
That, by the fresh groans of men,
I could bear a sorrow, which sorrow shows
To too sore laid, i' the cure
Of three-pence; and 'tis bid me joy:
but death, how camest thou, how severe
Shall sorrow report the soul!

EMILIA:
I cannot but tell:
'Tis pity of him.

EMILIA:
The king, why, how he glisters,
That he regrows, what he rootains, and he leaves it
Toist the throne of a respected king.

ESCALUS:
He does not look for issue,
Repinctly cup, with a kind of light.

QUEEN MARGARET:
We hear his moan, the sorrow of his looks,
Such as the flesh of fools in the world,
To look so poorly and to glance so fair.

ESCALUS:
O, no more!

DUKE OF YORK:
Who saw't, think you?

QUEEN MARGARET:
The sorrow that delivers us to make us wretched.

ESCALUS:
Come, be apart;
Condemn us to your deaths. See
Ourself the plain devil; and tell us what's the matter;
I know, and will be hated to those
 that eye thee not.

DUKE OF YORK:
Be patient, gentle queen, and sit;
For we will to God and these lands together
In lists, but we will know our mind.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Now tell me, madam,--

DUKE OF YORK:
Who knows it not?

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou, now I know thy mind--to pluck him thence
To Bolingbroke, by false means, false means,
To lie under our meaning,
Shuts up his windows, and locks far daylight
By need and accident, by need and accident.
So shall you rest, if you awake.

GREEN:
God on earth, and heaven!

QUEEN MARGARET:
So must I as I love the people.

KING HENRY VI:
So must he be patient.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Who, his name?

KING HENRY VI:
Not that name, but that he knew
Theldom of the king, and that there were no more
less for this place than heaven.

QUEEN MARGARET:
If some one of you have learn'd from whence you have left
To go to Ireland, 'tis by your leave:
'Tis by Jesu, your king, and by my name there
My brothers are: I have descried,
And now by good testimony,--a silly woman
More free than he is the queen's.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, that was your grace.

QUEEN MARGARET:
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.

What, art thou against the Duke of Hereford,
As against the Duke of Bretagne?

BENVOLIO:
If thou wilt take it not peril your honour's neck
With a embracements of Sir Froth, then 'tis good;
The Duke of Bretagne is your hate:
And as this gentleman is, I am against the Duke of Bretagne
Those lands of chosen soldiers, as they are not China.

ROMEO:

BENVOLIO:
Come, men, you confute not so.

ROMEO:
Methinks I am thus bold to put your power in mind
Of what you promised is done.

BENVOLIO:
But is it good, think you?

ROMEO:
If I know the noble tribunes for't,
I will in them;
And you shall show good testimony to ame
That I, your country's high, have to the united

I am too sure of it.

To one that thought to fill his grave in quiet.

BENVOLIO:
A consul!

Nurse:

Too mean to me, I will not be doing.

ROMEO:
What, art thou against us?

BENVOLIO:
Be so, because I heard it.

ROMEO:
Thou must be so, because both of us are
Mine.

BENVOLIO:
My husband is an't like you.

ROMEO:
I will wish him well.

Makes me most ill, so neither pity,
Say'st thou most unworthy.

ROMEO:
I will wish me happy, were not the worst.

BENVOLIO:
Well, then.

ROMEO:

And threatened me with death, going on a post he came
From this goodly Duke of York.
Thou breakest! what!

BENVOLIO:

I will look on it and look on it.

ROMEO:
Cannot be: every letter he hath toused
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest his body after the wounds he melts:
O, I'll giving my soul's consent to marry
Ere men were fond, and I with tears do protest
The times of death.

BENVOLIO:
Why, then the watch is mine.

ROMEO:

I will look on it and look on it.
'Tis here the county stays.

BENVOLIO:
In the mean time, against thou'rt,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our intent.

ROMEO:
Give me the letter; I will look
Where the villain lives, and he will think
To every pellet, every pellet,
And every officer his lord.

For the poor king's name is ominous.

Tut, from the light of heaven and your honour,
I see, and hear it by:
Give me the letter, the which thou hath
Is my lord's gift.

BENVOLIO:
Give me the letter, the father being the messenger,
That hath return'd my death;
Or what if I shall, away shall I have?

In praises sauced with lies.

Come, come, you must go visit the next room.
The door is open, and there your kindred's vault,
Where will you be loath to be so reclaim'd.

Why, therefore you hear fed upon my counsel,
Why he should choose himself a wife,

With modest warrant.

If I could reach them,
'Tis with my sword. I do know
Prosperity's the very theme
Of this lamentable day wherein I profess

Though he be blunt, I am withal.

Would he make us quiet?

BRUTUS:
The doubt he made us quiet.

MENENIUS:
No;
We must talk in public;
For what we say he made us quiet.

BRUTUS:
Lest he be hated,
We censure him.

MENENIUS:
Because he would not spare to gird the gods
When he did climate our wars
Then were his looks methought:
but we do know when he heard
The noble tribunes charged him.

MARCIUS:
That's all as monstrous to our worth as
To our i' the people's officer.

Beseech you,
Let us say farewell.

And not jealous;
We say we were made for your voices.

The people will not be good to Rome,
But keep their power to endure the worst.

And be no rash in our assembly.

As little joy may you suppose in me.

And crossly to your times of bloody reckoning?

And were you content to be ruled,
That of your bearing misery you might be some scope
More than the infant that is born to-night
I thank you for your humility.

DUKE OF YORK:
If I were thy crown, this should by combat
Be with me;
The king, contented, proud, and himself
To this cruel bawd.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I cannot tell:
For I will hammer thee with a rapier's point,
To be at charges too cruel for myself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So many of us means
That we render you this Look where you lie,
Showing no way to cross my talk withal;
If I do not see, to make your majesty
More rich for what I am, by course,
But by my fancy, by your hate,
And I'll be hated to your height
Whereever you please.

KING HENRY VI:
The thought of not dread, but at my feet I beg,
As cruel as the thought tried
Against the Duke of York, but at my feet
I cannot but call you up.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Not sleeping, waking, insulting, loving,
Shall I wear my being one.

KING HENRY VI:
Should be! should be! should--
Since you are darken'd with him, sleep and
the lust of night.

EXETER:
By like his heart, I cannot brook the flatter
Of any cord that may round his brow
Like envious thrust of ten.

KING HENRY VI:
Be ruled by me, forget of
my bidding hand and body.

YORK:
Hence, and away!

KING HENRY VI:
I'll bear thee company.

YORK:
Brother, you muse what chat we two have said.

WARWICK:
The widow's champion in my soul,
The uncase'd champions, those two kings
That thought on you.

KING HENRY VI:
The king!

YORK:
Why, what's he that I,
The queen's champion and defence.

KING HENRY VI:
A blessed labour, such as you to Clarence' case,
Among fresh children, Richard, are dead:
But still am I, or you must rule.

YORK:
I hope,
Will our brother come; that who parted either part
To Richard's himself, where he heard
What land was mine enemy:
My lords of England, you saw him fight,
And I will follow you.

KING HENRY VI:
Who meets us here?

YORK:
While I were thus bared,
Methinks I heard of his majesty.
Cousin, what pity was he,
That did scornfully slaughter me as I come?
But heaven, not a tomb, any oath,
To yield to our England's royal throne?
So that our nails
Should once upon the ground behold this black-hearted king,
And know held without our hearts!
Who builds his hopes but bloody steeds?

Messenger:
 hopes so.

GLOUCESTER:
So doth not this, which whet of good looks,
To win a vulgar king from the bosom of the north,
With which already frown hath made the cave my spring,
Where the poor Henry is his enemies are his enemies.

YORK:

Or what we impart?

CATESBY:
If flatter'd you, we may not spare to slack our course,
But, as we lay, here is Carlisle living.

Keeper:
Carlisle, how hathe young prince will come about.

EXTON:
If he may eat, were he not wont to be talked withal.

Keeper:
Will't please your son to come down to-day?

EXTON:
Shall satisfy your highness and your highness my duty.

Keeper:
Where I should lay an oldcrook with a broken hilt.

EXTON:
Are you in earnest, sir?

Keeper:
Please your ladyship, ask yonder knight in your mind.

EXTON:
If he had been a bawd, I would desire
The life of him.

Keeper:
But I cannot tell:
Both are in the north-wind.

EXTON:
Cold friends to hands, and with their friends there,
And with that cold courage, myself,
Carest with that hand that would hardly
Came to me for the death of Rome,
Nor with the envy of the two.

Keeper:
Think you so, sir?

EXTON:
Not that I have been there.

Keeper:
Not that I have, I pray thee, by your good offer.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, no, by your means; but your will
That I have to spend and one thing I have to twice
To thrise, and your consent is of no moment,
More than the singularity of a grave.

Keeper:
Are you in earnest, sir?

EXTON:
For I cannot but be sad; but, I warrant you,
If you be so melancholy and so, I pray,
When I should be with you straight.

Keeper:
Madam, I pray you, as you will.

PETRUCHIO:
If I cannot, I will lay,
And presently repair to bring you.

Keeper:
From your means I heard this said,
'An't please your majesty, players
My country, my nurse, this nurse,
That stays upon them, I'll lean unto them;
Yea, and whatsoever word you curse the matter.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, fit you.

Keeper:
Yonder comes news.

PETRUCHIO:
Your majesty!

PETRUCHIO:
Say not one jot by the mile
Here is your lord?

BARDINE:
How he lands.

Keeper:
I cannot tell: but he does Show us
his wounds in their different greeting,
Off being ne'er so far as another man's,
And craves your pardon to amend,
When he could draw a sword, I'll pity him;
The selfsame pity of his majesty,
The present benefit and to rejoice in,
That he did, I'll be revenged.

PETRUCHIO:
And I thank you, general;
But thus I mean to take my leave,
And thus I thank you.

Keeper:
You are deceived;
You promise me, I will not aid you.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, so she will, I am beguiled.

Keeper:
Why, so he thinks, by yourvery words:
My faults he made, I would fain be ruled,
Which you have touch'd; he made me humble,
But by his humble hum kind I am humble;
He was not to me. My faults
To you; to your scorn and my message,--

PETRUCHIO:
In what?

Keeper:
He will do it, or say that:
I pray now, walk. There is a letter from him:
The which he looks from his state;
 give me an estate of prayer and farewell:
I will not do it, pray you;
Meantime, but when I pray'd, he show'd me;
'Tis past, but I do see.

PETRUCHIO:
O me, he shall not.

Keeper:
A letter, sir!

PETRUCHIO:
Yes, me; put up; you must be gone.
I will fetch you a ladder,
To be found false and recreant to your hangman.

Keeper:
I will prove the contrary, sir, ere you'll cross the seas.

ClIFFORD:
I cannot tell:
So please your majesty
To Padua here is come, gentle father,
To speak with you and your brother.
I would to God, my lord!

CLIFFORD:
O, dear mother!
How is't with her?

EMILIA:
Sweet sir, as you and I
love the man that dear I love,
That I desire to live free from the rebels?

BUCKINGHAM:
You do not know how he holds up to rost:
The thought of my rights and jealous;
My words come from his majesty;
And therefore soundly. I say to thee,
If e'er this hand, of mine,
Shall be the right of man and child.

YORK:
O, that must be! nay, let it be;
Or I will not budge
To some foul issue: yet breathless coward,
As thou art not sick for love.

AUCKINGHAM:
God's cause, noble lord!

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O me! who else gage him with the thought of him?

AUCKINGHAM:
SOMERSET:
Will not God send me word by-night?

EMILIA:
No, pray, sir, nor by words' short banishment,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by the fair mother's means I come
To this attempt.

YORK:
If God prevent not,
An I were at once would wish
He had his life a slaughter-day.

O Margaret, she is come; it is not his word:
If he hear thee, 's death,
And I'll not live long.

PARIS:
I would to God, my lord.

YORK:
'Tis pity of him.

MONTAGUE:
Be not your gaoler, then;
I am better by fit to our request,
By one 'score yourself.

EDWARD:
When you talk of peace, sweet boy,
Methinks he looks as clear of mind,
But yet his eye's consent is more pertinent
Than the severity of the public power.

MONTAGUE:
Then be your reason urged on that proceeding:
He, as he will not stumble,
To more purpose.

EDWARD:
Yet I wish, gentle keeper,--
I mean, when, with love and honour,
First were we happy in our brother's unity,
This love which I dearly love.

YORK:
Why, so then some thing is past.

KING EDWARD IV:
Farewell, lords. I'll to London;
To see these lands and these lands
Dared before his majesty.

YORK:
What! we will not spare to say.

WARWICK:
Why, how now, sweet lords! I fear,

These lands and my people blaze to burn them!

YORK:
Mine, whereof shall I thrive, if they kept
To bear the royalty of our majesty.

WARWICK:
Even as we stood,
 they would not thread us.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, Edward, she shall not be there,
When, with his grumbling voice, Warwick and Montague.

WARWICK:
From Scotland am I stol'n,
Even in the chair of war,
To this supposed,.

YORK:
That in revengeful mind,
Which finds an argosy to the guilt,
That honour and envy of the one.

KING EDWARD IV:
Withal we heard never to hear,
Only to by the happy report of the queen;
Her brother's death, by battery of herself,
A moat defensive to a house
That longing have I never to see.

MONTAGUE:
I cannot but hear, that I must yield my body
To some vantage.

KING EDWARD IV:
Brother, I will tell you what these lands
 are fell upon me:
The lands that we have, our lives and these lands
We cannot without circumstance descry.

DUKE OF YORK:
Well, therefore, I do what I can,
By this I can I will help you, design me
More than the common people's welfare,
And be you answer'd to what you think.

WARWICK:
I know not where; but let your tongue's dread
With that dead silence often of speaking,
Where will

CLIFFORD:
Which is another thing that is not so; yet his sister
To Richard: Lorded by marriage,
'Tis he is advised now to Rome,
And all is Death's by rebellion against himself.

WARWICK:
What is it, gallant boy?

CLIFFORD:
A child born, bred.

YORK:
Your only choice.

KING HENRY VI:
Besides, if you had not a heart the burthen,
You would have given again the corn gratis an hour
To make you proud, you would have been more pitiful.

YORK:
Nine of one boy.

RICHARD:
Nine! Come; I would that twenty
seven.

EDWARD:
And yet, I fear,--

YORK:
Three.

YORK:
Three.

PRINCE EDWARD:
'Tis tired: boy, I will--

YORK:
I will look up.

EDWARD:
O, sweet York! I fear, I can tell you.
Come, lords, you shall be with me to supper;
Meantime, therefore, shall I make my way,
And bring you news of thy what we intend
To endure friends and friends of the state.

YORK:
Give way unto the market-place.

Pray God, I may be with you in the people's officer,
Or I'll show myself a private hangman.

RICHARD:
I cannot tell:
What men are willing to this?

YORK:
Must I bring my son to you?

YORK:
Ay, ay.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Come, come, we'll prompt you.

YORK:
I beg your ladyship.

KING HENRY IV:
I would he had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your eyebrows.

YORK:
Why, therefore let me lack them.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me not bid me, sweet uncle, for I will
 cuckaetho my will not with flowers.

YORK:
You will not need, I know,
That I have lesser than one's need to
perjury.

KING HENRY VI:
I'll lay fourteen of our teeth,--
And yet, to the teeth too easy, I will
look upon.

YORK:
Why, uncle, thou must be patient: I will bite thee
down,
To find more of thee than the sword I have.

KING HENRY VI:
No, but for the last,--
Ay.

YORK:
Why, uncle,--

KING HENRY VI:
What! fear not, that I may sing and dance.

YORK:
For you and I; and I'll lean upon them;
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
I will not be king, issue out of dust.

SOMERS:
Why, 'tis better: I will not be king.

YORK:
Why, 'twas you that chased you from the dirt
Hath made no chase.

KING HENRY VI:
Mount no thought of him: something savours.
Cousin, I dare cry you mercy;
And I, by you deposed, have deserved so much
To prick the dust within your power.

YORK:
Consider my succession, and 'tis then alive.

KING HENRY VI:
The pretty cousins is gone, and Warwick rages.
'Tis but Edward is escaped from your brother,
Who is more remorseless in our meaning,
Than all the great fortune of fortune and Henry.
'Tis almost forgot, my lord; my lord hath lost it all.

QUEEN:
Let me be king, Edward's substitute,
His adopted heir, by consent to marry:
But now the shadow of his title buried--
 must Edward be so.

WARWICK:
What title hast thou, gentle uncle?

PRINCE EDWARD:
The title of kings and queens of queens;
TheCountess of uncles, by the queen's gift,
To uncles timeless; her brother, by the hand:
Edward of Bona, by the hand of war,
That only the root was fix'd in the fault of me.

CLIFFORD:
The root was fix'd on king Henry's body,
And fix'd by murdering knife Henry's enemies.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let's hear.

BRUTUS:
You must be patient.

MENENIUS:
Who is't?

BRUTUS:
Not possible;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

MENENIUS:
If, by your modest actions
And your honour, I may--

BRUTUS:
To be precise; and precise
We need to raze one place out:
If for us to come too late of our intents,
Our substitutes at home shall have
Our praises tell our chinks.

BRUTUS:
O let's hear how the surly fools do attend on us;
The Romans are cheap buy of us.

Thea!

BRUTUS:
The a!

MENENIUS:
I know, I know.

BRUTUS:
You see how he holds up bands and reconcilomsils!

MENENIUS:
Fie! no, no!
This is a Marcius, his enemy.

BRUTUS:
He will though usurp the gifts he gives,
Were as cruel as the interchange of gifts that
He is set enemy to the desirers.

MENENIUS:
But is he won?

BRUTUS:
He'll lose by it.

MENENIUS:
But is he won by any honest man's house?

BRUTUS:
He'll steal by your loves,--

MENENIUS:
What?

BRUTUS:
The people will not be his used for the purpose.

MENENIUS:
When he's as freely open to the purpose.

COMINIUS:
Show them--as all who have to say
The people tribunes for Rome.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, let them hear me speak.

BRUTUS:
You will not own it.

MENENIUS:
Let them tell you.

BRUTUS:
You'll mar him too, Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Why, Marcius!

BRUTUS:
Not of this country, though he were a citizen,
Not proud to Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Brutches!

BRUTUS:
We'll mar.

MENENIUS:
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

MENENIUS:
Yes,

BRUTUS:
Why, what else?

MENENIUS:
God save your good worships! Marcius!

VOLUMNIA:
Stay!
Look, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy pity.

MENENIUS:
He will not spare to gird the gods.

BRUTUS:
Consider further trial,
That he may be thrown down the Tarpeian rock,
With rigorous hands, nay, and no further trial.

MENENIUS:
Be ruled by him.

BRUTUS:
Who is't that is his constant part?

MENENIUS:

BRUTUS:
Are there no more eyes among you?
You must be seen to heard of!

MENENIUS:
Hail, Marcius!

BRUTUS:
May not Cominius speak?

MENENIUS:
He will show your disposition,
And not be talked with your bitterest.

BRUTUS:
Be ruled by him.

MENENIUS:
If he did not deal that kind of young and noble
Of noble Marcius, thou wouldst not esteem
The youngest of our two sons.

COMINIUS:
If it would please him to come down.

MENENIUS:
If he did not know our mind,
We may have consider'd him our sister sire,
And be inheritor of my kind when he cross
These frowns of mine.

COMINIUS:
If he did not think me for the grave,
Where I stand you by, he did me scorn
The very way I serve;
And was not clear dawning, when I am
Here.

He will not?

What's he?

BRUTUS:
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O him,
If he had been a woman

COMINIUS:
That's all as monstrous to our divining.

May show so where he is at liberty,
And that my pity may not be further
Than so much to him.

SICINIUS:
He is the enemy
To the people and his fame.

MENENIUS:
Be he revenged!

BRUTUS:
But he was not at all.

MENENIUS:
When he did seem to be people's mouths,
Scandal'd the very people, begets his penitence
To say 'th and to's teeth,
And teeth,--as misery
Persuades me,--and the all-cheering
Of misery.

MENENIUS:
He was thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he settled,
And had no softer cushion than the flint,
Must never brook'd the noise,--

Scratches i' the consuls' of the people,
But mock'd the noise that banishment.

MENENIUS:
The gods of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
This pretty lad, that did never hear,
Did threat and encourage him;
The gods, not fearing him,
Have left him with the child,
To chase all the other home, by rage and war,
To choke theious of a mother's body,
And choke the gods of men.

SICINIUS:
Who knows not where he is?

His multiplying spawn how can he flatter--

Mine honour!

MENENIUS:
At certain words he said,
He would not have you heard
The noble tribunes' entreaties.

You would not cry'd mercy,
Have he merit it.

Shall we hear of your coming?
If for the beastliest, abortive must we hear
The happy man is my father!

GLOUCESTER:

As many sons brother brother mellow'd,
Shall bear burthen, unmeritable day,
As wind-shall'd.

Bianca:
Where be these enemies?

GLOUCESTER:
Methinks I should be hated,
And be at enmity
With cozening hope of gain and dissembling looks.
But yet, I beseech thee, be not so hush'd
To prick thy finger, chasing thee with
Of fury: be patient, gentle father.

BUSHY:
If I were thy necessity for a wife,
Thou'ldst not be better than any man's;
But I'll write unto some gossipsy,
To cease all dissembling.
'Tis since to me less expected,
Than to be by oath enjoin'd.

GLOUCESTER:
And to conclude with truth, I would,
If this king had known my mind.

BUSHY:
But since you come too rashly,
Yet witness with me, King Warwick,
And you too, of such post-hanging stars
As Iago; but yet witness may never
My soul of living fire upon my body,
For how often quaked, and how my joints forget
To yew and seal'd together, that quaked,
This hand, thus notes of man
Shall rust upon my guilty hand;
And yet, say I play the idle thine,
Thou must be patient till the prince come;
And I, as thou art experienced,
That dieles in extremity.

GLOUCESTER:

BUSHY:
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

KING HENRY VI:
What say'st thou, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Shall I be heard of your highness' tongue?

BUSHY:
I, by promise, will go on
To take my leave of you.

GLOUCESTER:
When 'twas said, my lord.

KING HENRY VI:
Well, I will.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me stand aloof, and I will not live,
I willeech you, tenderly.

KING HENRY VI:
O, be so beseech you, give me leave:
I'll do what I will command,
In giving and what I will be doing.

GLOUCESTER:
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with black mourning gowns?
Or will our bodies' were black and coy'd skulls?

BUSHY:
I know what to say.

GLOUCESTER:
That you deny toMe.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, then, I'll do what your right:
Heaven let me bear my lovely face!

GLOUCESTER:
When I did sleep, I supposed you'd not how I thought.

BUSHY:
'Tis not to me, no, not your right.

GLOUCESTER:
The rest, all cause to me grief.

KING HENRY VI:
Father, you mistake the matter;
The king, you trust, hath got the holy man.

GLOUCESTER:
The king! why, then,--

KING HENRY VI:
Show me the indictment of your majesty.

GLOUCESTER:
I; Dukes it so, I know.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Pardon me, then, let me know it not:
Who ever bares he say you did infect my life?

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, when I supposed you sought the life.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, then,--as all the love I bear your majesty,
That bear your hate upon my grave,
Shall I dearly love my dark heart.
When I did see the

Which easily endures no title, but glory,
To quit me no more worthy.

EDWARD:
Sweet father, as thou livest, I sleep.

WARWICK:
Groose! that we all came down,
From whence we came?

EDWARD:
From such a cruel threatening look,
As hasty powder fired in the sun:
Some tardy cripple bore the posts,
That came too lag to see him buried.

WARWICK:
Where is the Duke of Clarence? where is he?

CLARENCE:
Where on he stands, as he should do
With bootless men, as one were past
I would by and go on him. Would any but
these two cousins of York
Have done hips or eyes?

WARWICK:
Ay; and some two of them?


YORK:
Three.

WARWICK:
Why, Warwick, and Potpan!

YORK:
Why, that I were as great as my name!

WARWICK:
That's Edward, the lord of Calais.

YORK:
Who builds his hopes in air of your majesty's
With promise of his majesty, what is become of him?

WARWICK:
No, Warwick, no, but that is kind of brother,
And were the title of a valiant Warwick,
Wouchsafe to furnish us
Where some few of us have broke our promised proportions
Then some few hours shall pass,
That ne'er shall so fastly,
To prick the clouds with his report.

YORK:
He's hearing of a cause,
May say 'Alas,' and that succession be
In whose success thou seest, haply shall
Be heap'd as it is.

WARWICK:
And he'll hear no more.

LORD FITZWATER:
What counsel, lords?

KING EDWARD IV:
Sorrow and grief of heart, the king unto the king!

YORK:
Ye wait on fortune; therefore follow me,
And I direct you how you shall arraign him.

KING EDWARD IV:
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay my tongue.

YORK:
To hear our mindift, thus smoothly, isfits my mind.
O, full of danger and deep'st!
I cannot but weep, and I will watch thy death:
Shall I be advised that our two cousins kiss the earth.

WARWICK:
Can right, and never be forget strong?
Death lies on me, and these my sons' graves
Being once more do tread the earth's cold Caucasus.

YORK:
Break, and thrive: the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee thine honour: lean lean thought upon thee,
The sure look of shame, and in compassion
Where kings and queens range; even this ruthless king
Would not envy, bound to himself.

KING EDWARD IV:
O Margaret, thus told,
What title peril, and thou shalt know,
From all the sign of warlike Clifford's head
And from the all-look'd for, see,
And buried in the royal throne,
Write more on me, and that thou, brave Earl of Exeter,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canoes
Amongst the loving Welshmen can of merit,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canoes o' the north,
Among whose miles and land.

MONTAGUE:
O, thus, thou walk'd with unquiet looks,
As doth deceive, and false Clarence too?

KING EDWARD IV:
Well, I do, for this drivelling love
Is of a good memory,Who who, as thou call'd,
Did spit down trees and didst send two of thy pride
To execute the blacker against the wind.

YORK:
Some strong link may help it, but that the weaker sort,
Amongby fulltrial and free pardon,
Now come to pierce a corslet with his teeth,
Aiming the high-swoln heart with his gnaw'd hand
In moral proceedings, and falling in years,
Be heap'd a year to live, this King Edward's friend.

YORK:
He that will not fight for such a hope.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sweet brother, as we stand up in the field
Ere he got the lands, he got them.

MONTAGUE:
Then I pray thee, gentle Lady Bona, tell
Thy mind thou wast that which poets by fortune
Profaned.

BONA:

TUS:
All-amazed, mine own. My child is dead;
And with my broken hands I seal my truth.

Lord:
The thing I have, the heaven with my soul.
Look, how thy wife and mothere!
Most mighty wife!

Nurse:
Away! the heaven!

JULIET:
So I'll home to France,
And stay my wife there.

Nurse:
Now breathe this news;
Dost thou not laugh?

JULIET:
What news?

Nurse:
Old John, how ha' thee!

JULIET:
What! give me leave?

JULIET:
What news?

Nurse:
Old John, I know, that you have
To say is true: and that is most certain,
when they lie in the dirt.

JULIET:
That is no more slander to men's bosom,
Than so, all proofs sleeping else.
What, at once laid, or to death?

Nurse:
Things sweet to taste, and my friend's happiness is
To Richard:
He is perfect then, we are off,
He is not dead, but by some unlook'd accident,
Yet witness may as soon as determine.

JULIET:
If from sorrow he so sharp,
That to the death he gave I could myself,
Then I would esteem him worth a thousand good-day.

Nurse:
As good to him, I would;
Therefore, to-morrow:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.

JULIET:
To-morrow, then,--

Nurse:
What, pray thee, tell me, is it not yours?

JULIET:
Why, knows me not!

Nurse:
Send, why, 'tis not your daring cry.

JULIET:
If from your knees I can but sigh
Anon I cannot but with mine eye
Mine honour my gages and my health.
What! I cannot tell: 'tis by my arm,
My love's the secret nightingale,
That I love! love! love!

JULIET:
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.

Nurse:
Take thou some happy gage! some joyful gage!

JULIET:
If love be blind! why talking with a child,
Both of the child, being one
Too late bound to know than that love!

Nurse:
Your husband is dead: why, 'twas pity.

JULIET:
If husband's daughter have any grat me,
Whither I am going with him,
By Him that knows not so.
O, he is lame! love!

Nurse:
Why, 'twas all these other flattering sounds,
Some comet or unusual prodigy!
He bears the title of a proud man,
To ape in a man's ape-mark'd to-day.

JULIET:
Why, and I trust, he will not be a gier
Than man's reported to us.

Nurse:
When I was last in Holborn,
Marry. My women are made to gage
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
Because their number of servants were whip'd up.

JULIET:
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes the day more enrich'd than the earth:
'Tis in my heart,
Made by my child, from my broken heart:
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more, I'll take thou
To see this knack and devise,
More than this idle thresost, here we heard
What power the heavens in this blessed man
Should so soon know whether they were at their pleasure!

Drinking on their haste, I did not know
The noble tribunes for the poor thing when we were chosen
His captain Christ had left me no more of him
Than what we crave; and, if we remember,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
We'll subscribe them of some large sums of gold
And make them where we need should do.

Nurse:
Madam, I know, they are near as thoughts,
Though they cannot at once try one thing held out.

LEONTES:
 they will love that did usurp the place;
And, if they fall, we'll bury them in the dead bodies.

EDWARD:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more but what I have said
And couldures me to be a suitor. content thy thoughts,
Whilst I remember I said, happy words to thee,
I cannot forget
Which jest, to have been thus bold with mine heart,
To speak so bitter, black, obscene to myself,
For selfsame tired, by two of two days,
And twelve days, of that sorrow,
Which never felt me to anyught but death,
Some unborn sorrow, as was most guilty
Of my conception. Now, as the mind
Commands, devise a thought of me, in what hatred
Shall be your winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good; and better for you all:
If you please Warwick, we'll show you where you are
And make you where you are, of what rest you may.
But what you please me, and what your pleasure is,
That is, such good words finds you here;
And, if you please Warwick, we'll draw you down.

WARWICK:
To be at charges, therefore Warwick stands;
And whatsoever he lean unto,
As of a bearing, I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood lies:
Therefore mark my lords, give me leave, and pray,
While I live, to make some measure
To blood jointure that marriage-day.

WARWICK:
So, underneath my yoke of doom and thine
Sorroweth with the sorrow that I have,
To cease the civil suit of York,
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I judge; O, by this,
I thank you, that you have done me wrong,
And therefore therefore, ere I were queen,
To prick thy finger, point by report,
Shall wound my honour with report of what is past,
Even for revenge mock my destruction.

EDWARD:
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike,
More than your dancing soul's parting with my soul!

WARWICK:
What presence must your highness have
To be your highness' pleasure?

GEORGE:
Where it seems best to fall to me last night
And never need such apology; but yet, as I think,
My highness shall not be my king I divorce:
Me giving the lie, if being so young and so,
And what my pleasure is, shall be shortly:
For royalty's a bond of condition
Long die strain, and 'tis called out
To one that were not kings.

EDWARD:
Let me know my fault:
I will not endure't.

WARWICK:
Why, that I were a king,
I was sworn a king, and thou were sworn
To aught before thou wast king,
When I was sworn sworn sworn sworn as king.

EDWARD:
Now, my sovereign,--

WARWICK:
What says your highness to my just demand?

WARWICK:
My royal liege, I cannot tell:
Too late, yet my kingdom'sTire
My due by rebellion and my oath is vain to speak.

KING RICHARD:
It must be so:
What says your highness to my just demand?

WARWICK:
My queen, as I am queen, by your leave?

GEORGE:
My queen, this is not your queen's noble husband,
The son of Edward the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and cities.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick is my seat.
Now therefore therefore therefore therefore therefore say I love your majesty.
 Lady Bona, my fair rose, must I or
Forso I can my merrily awhile be no more!

BONA:
My lord, what says your highness to my just demand?

GEORGE:
Sweet widow, by my state I dare not get your husband's lands;
I am not my pate-man till my lands were levied,
Which have not been blue, but only they
That blue Neptune, had I as lief take my leave of thee,
On cruel cruel Hastings' wretched head!
Now, therefore, I have a soul with me,
To desire upon unlo'd him for my life unto eternity,
And in compassion spend the soul of banishment
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
Which deep duty of mine outweighs my need;
And so deep duty ungravely lant high as to curse.

And were they crown'd so high, themselves would fly.

WARWICK:

Why, so they are, here are they are taking angry note.

SOMERSET:
What's the matter Margaret, my lord?

KING HENRY VI:
Hie, fie! let's ha't: these are a three days
Endured the dust that divorce your brother from your bed:
Now, by the moon I spring, and these her sons
To Haggard are like two of those
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
Short but one of them is so fastous as a man's horse;
My brother's son shall be in my stalls,
And all the white and not the flower.
Shall I bring thee to the gates of York,
And bid the man bid me argue in steel?
No, no, no, my lord;
For that I was king,
And that I am now, my sworn.

YORK:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

WARWICK:
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I think there had been in strong a kind of course,
To make a brittle peace with him or no,
When they have broke faith to-morrow.

YORK:
Shall we go?

KING HENRY VI:
To see this be so true, if we'll not
Shall lose the holy right of Lancaster.
If God will be contrary,
Yet will I make my heaven in steel.
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
To tear with thunder the cloudy motive of some
That looks not heavily to what is in this cup
That bears the title of the king:
Besides, if things go right, and tell false Edward
His lamentable name of comnity.

YORK:
If I should be! O pity!
He beth within!

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet mother, be so bold to plead for right!

Boy:
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the worldWere any and me can play.

KING HENRY VI:
If I know thou not this castle's right,
Be thou as young, as thou art.

QUEEN MARGARET:
No, by my soul, I will not rear
Like this the hare that belongs to me.

KING HENRY VI:
Let me embrace thee, gentle queen, as thou art.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So will your majesty.

YORK:
For I will board me, being the best
In all this presence, and never be
The flower of March.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, therefore delay not: let your majesty
Tugged you, and so mine, were you this effect.

Boy:
Why, therefore delay not: lets your majesty
Tremble with your husband's blood, and make us minstrels
As you intended.

KING HENRY VI:
That I could tell you plainly what I think,
You lie not mine?

Boy:
You lie, and speak not simple, you should be more pitiful.

KING HENRY VI:
You are not king, but basely by your looks:
Before I be a subject fit to instruct you,
Your majesty, my lord, must come down.

KING HENRY VI:
Northumberland, thou where the Kentishmen are to breathe
And feast of kings and queens.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And were I but twenty-five-and-married,
My lord, my house and my daughter were to be dieted
In your royal presence, then I'ld revolt to make
Twenty-seven suits of the house of York.

EDWARD:
I cannot help it:
O pomp, majesty! thy famous father
Doth live.

YORK:
His duty is as boundless as the eightest
In Lord Angelo.

Messenger:
Away! let's fetch his son unto the block
In the giving of our own.

Which do forerun me, do offend my heart
And I am pale to look upon him.

But that the strong warrant of

ANTIGONUS:
If they do see thee here, why, there's some pity sitting
Betwixt thee and these poor compounds that thou mayst not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by wishing, but as the measure
From our some eyes-glass. Come, let's away.

Pray your, take a fan: and I'll ride,
As fast as any flan'd could.

Makes a kind of feeding.

O, that thy horse fell

FLORIZEL:
What!
I know, I do not know:
Go, get aboard; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that, loath to me,
Will be so bier than I could,
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
Thy friend is right and all beside
To Bolingbroke.

ANTIGONUS:
Hail, royal prince! I have solemnly told you
How he princelylylyly father and the king
Look'd upon you and made you clean i' the heaven!

PAULINA:
O father!
Look, sir!
This lady, what thy wife's father and daughters,
Thy beauty, her mother's name,
And all these familiar words, are her wedding-day
Stol'n marriage, his oath enrolled in
The same I am, this is your gift,
To unloose the last.

LEONTES:
Give me some mourning ere I bid thee stay.

PAULINA:
It was the day o' the year,
How long shall't now bear this tidings,
So long as you and I thank you all.

LEONTES:
In tears I wash'd the blood away;
Which, to wash the blood away,
Shall fill the springs with too deep incontinent:
Methinks 'twas told me once to touch,
How he did lap me with the hand
Of this black heart.

PAULINA:
The swifter horse than the horse.

LEONTES:
He dropp'd me like a bear.

PAULINA:
So I did:
For which my soul is great; and is it not
Too deep i' the earth to be awaked,
Since this place of peace is scarce any longer.

LEONTES:
Where dwellest thou, gentle maiden,Here in the Tower.

PAULINA:
I dare live,
Save that I live awhile.

LEONTES:
I'll bear thee my body, my soul!

PAULINA:
Why, that 'Heart's great sorrow craves as heart,
As 'twere a bury.

LEONTES:
Why, thou wrong'st it not.

PAULINA:
For I will lay fourteen years and a half,
To which far I promised,
No fit to be a lean and still winter where I live:
Yea, and not, I fear;
I but live, and mean.

LEONTES:
In those holes
Do I still mean a peevish;
Where, as they say, I strew'd your stones,
And look'd upon you.

PAULINA:
O,
You have made my riches secure,
You and your friends you have, you have
To thank you, the exchequer of the poor
Coriolanus, and the consul.

LEONTES:
Once more, take it up straight:
Give it again, or whether you will.

PAULINA:
Well, I must do it:
If, by all the hopes I have about me,
We come to you upon our brother;
And therefore, I pray thee, let me desire
The present benefit which you have advanced
Doth point you to't: beseech you,
Remember since you did but think to seek the people
How he holds you to depose yourself.

LEONTES:
We'll do it:
I'll mine own part,
Which you profane, were to give,
With liege-work of your custom,
Which you rather must employ me than with jett
Remnants of my files and his ashes;
Which, in the base court'sy gates
Besides his shouting show, the easy groans
Of mortals, that fall out, as if they respect

KING HENRY VI:
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
I have a pinch'd thing; yea, a and a deadly
thing to my heart, that sits in.

YORK:
A deadly groan, indeed.

WARWICK:
Methinks I should throw my gage,
If I could reach 'scape:
I am too mean a subject for thee;
Too cruel, to be as tender a subject as
I seem to be, to bend my limbs asunder.

YORK:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of him.

EDWARD:
Methinks I live live as well as I was by:
By giving him glory, I will not endure him.

YORK:
Be ruled by me, forget to think of him.

WARWICK:
Methinks I live as well as I was.

YORK:

Before I am too mean a subject for me.

EDWARD:
What, art thou mad, by ouranders?

YORK:
But I had rather be a pedlar: if he had been a
bred man, I would desire to hear noble work.

MONTAGUE:
O, by my rights, I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it.

QUEEN:
From such a cruel threatening and wrong as didst thou sleep.

YORK:
To tire it wereto kill a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Withhold revenge what thou justly speak'st,
And lay aside these ruthful iron-headed kingly thoughts,
Which were inshell'd by their spotted hate,
'Tis in my remembrance a sick man is living.

EDWARD:
What, at all this we free thee?

YORK:
Why, 'twas a thousand bastards
That issue out of dust and blood.

CLIFFORD:
'Tis no land of government.

RICHARD:
The king is grown too angry: why, 't thou,
Thou art not quickly moved to strike him soundly.

KING HENRY VI:
Then, Warwick, thus: 'twas nothing but
The son and heir of Edward's enemies;
And till we heard the spell,
To cease both our happy days and fall of kings.

WARWICK:
No more but he hath been used
Under my brother, and that is witness to that report.

Messenger:
What, art thou afraid?

SOMERSET:
Not fearing the wolf makes the sourmary
 bite of the eagles'er shewn:
Think but upon this sword.

WARWICK:
How! know'st thou afraid?

CLIFFORD:
Not fearing him, but self-affrighted.

YORK:
Think'st thou thy oath and Warwick's than mine.

WARWICK:
And that is no grace: for what can we devise
But kill the thing that we devise
More than we devise.

CLIFFORD:
To make our brother rid his hands of this?

YORK:
Ay, brother Clarence; and we'll all come to him.

KING HENRY VI:
But I, in this smooth discourse,
To report the truth of Clarence' death,
When he was reported in the field by rote,
commanded: the nobles in great earnestness are
In person and matters of great moment,
That we, the less foul mark of the night,
Should by have been more pitiful, than free from doubt
Of our envy.

WARWICK:
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewith the crown,
The right and the means to climb,
The rough uneven way of the smallest.

WESTMORELAND:
The shame that some fathers of this
To prick and unwedge unto you, and your centre to-achieving war.

CLIFFORD:
What, by this indictment of your brother?

WESTMORELAND:
The majesty of your grace, know you yet,
From Clifford's and
======================================== SAMPLE 221 ========================================
 lies
 provide'd by this intelligence, the king
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight.
If for this hand of Clarence, Edward will always loved thee;
But for the more that Henry's right,
Or than of his proud heart-blood, thou draw not
To stain the napkin with his blood.

CLARENCE:
Hold, my lords! I do not flatter
My patient heart with such feeble language
As 'twere used all too late!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, then Clarence is dead:
And living thou art not shameless:Where have I been,
More than when I was at odds,
When I had supplely interr'd these lands with
Those that you are now are wearied with?

CLARENCE:
To breathe these news in sweet clothes,
Which you profane, were to make
Sirly you bury me marvell'd:
Why, then Clarence is dead: that very day
When limken-mark'd souls were plotted,
Some of us would fly to France:
That which, when they supposed,
You would not have done, had but two days
To make a bloody piteous storm;
Besides, this thought did see some speech of treason;
And the good people would not let us win the right
To that which they so seem to fear.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Thus have we heard
From our faults, but we will hear
From our faults, whiles they grow.

OXFORD:
Poor queen! how cruel cousin!

YORK:
Foul wrinkled lord!

YORK:

How he flouted, and urged,
The words he spake, and urged,
The prayers of holy fools and
To faithful service of your majesty.
O gracious duke, he is not of me;
But, of you, that I may know what name to call him,
Being pent from liberty, as ye are darken'd in our throne,
With downright payment, show'd unto my enemy.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I cannot tell: but I must be
Mine own confession and in penalty alike
To your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
Grace to boot! what subject can your majesty say to me?

Bowl to me, my lord! what manner of fellow's he?

Dudes he not purpose to honour mine own truth out of me?
I'll claim by your means
To put myself to't: I am sworn
Upon my word, according to my oath and my oath,
To honour as you will duty and by your duty,
To go to him, and so,
You shall not only claim by your fair prayers;
But, as I think, you shall:
This afternoon, two days' days
Shall do the year and two years,
And bring you good days' health and happy days.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Where'er it be, I'll lay
Where'er you can, you shall not have it so.
Shall we go?

GLOUCESTER:
To-morrow, then?

QUEEN MARGARET:
To-morrow: I hope,
If you have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that you curse the poor king is doing,
Then our nails were alliddles
To-morrow are to-day,
That we might, if we had our revenge,
hunt this innocent child,

GLOUCESTER:
Who, no more! I ha' thee!

QUEEN MARGARET:

GLOUCESTER:

And will not let me live.

I'll back of whence before.

And are they of the same house Publius?

Where nothing but the loss of departing
And what the sands are laid aside.

And now confess you most unreasonably:

I know it, and will look to: behold,
And, if looking honourively from the all eye,
I will love thee, and desire thee too.

FLORIZEL:
Yes, by Saint Paul I can:
See here these rural latches to the city
Do lope and do not obeisance.

Citizens:
Do not quickly.

FLORIZEL:

Citizens:
To lose their heads, and not lend their dearest friend
To any friend that would call upon you;
Your greyhounds shall humbly remain
To fresh green and in compassion

Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up.

FLORIZEL:
Nay, follow me,

O,
You look'd so longly on her,
Such as the flesh was mine!

FLORIZEL:
O,
Such eyes the flesh of us must be dieted
With nourish, and so are lusty
As feed'd with dews; the prayers
To faithful service of them those wrong'd,
That are not China cushions boss'd with English spleen;
O, revenge my death!

Ay, such a pity as the adder's tooth;

ICHORK:
O happy dagger!

SOMERSET:
God mark'd, murderous lord!
Thy friend is dead, unless thing to-day.

EDWARD:
Methought, I saw my son: as the morning
Hath he shed no more than what I thought, I did not see him.

YORK:
He was warmer that got him than the beggar's of York.

EDWARD:
So then my soul, this is All's true.

YORK:
If murdering villain,
Then I respected; and most opportune to
This deadly quarrel was compounded.


EDWARD:
O, thou canst not now hold your peace until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father, with his right hand,
Can betreat you more than I thought you did when I did see
him.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewith thou ascends.

YORK:
The right-fted sun shines by night:
When I were last in Holborn,
I heard from Harry Duke of Clarence,
'Tis very true: and, if thou tell'st,
We'll do good to bury thee in the Tower.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
Attend forth the army, as partly to part with you.

KING HENRY VI:
Stay, you that bear the title of the king.

WARWICK:
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
And of their feather many proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the council;
But for the sceptre of the house of York
Among who should he tread'd but that day?

YORK:
What, would he make us guilty of this?

WARWICK:
He would not:
We made him sure, we all.

YORK:
If he be our sovereign,--as being always true,
We all should do so fast.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot do't without counters.

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, if he want your honour's pawn,
Open my letters to him and fetch the Lady
To your loving-house.
Now, therefore, I mine--
To Edward, come, that whatwith the crown,
Which thou after service, Lady Margery, and the third,
To him just and upright Lady Bona.

WARWICK:
What answer makes the Lady Bona mourn?

QUEEN MARGARET:
How many children hast thou, father?

BONA:
I pity your misery, but I dare excuse
What you have befall'n upon you.

WARWICK:

Lies my consent and fair according voice.

Whereto my consent is quite overthrown.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, that is all as true as I heard of before.

KING HENRY VI:
Sweet father, how do you thank the child?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, such good doth the prince, and all his thanks.

KING HENRY VI:
If I may turn the hate I have,
By pardoning Rutland, upon record,
My true appeal is as to put it in my mind.

YORK:
Before I being Plantagenet, how dares the prince
Take Henry of Lancaster again?

KING HENRY VI:
What title hast thou, gentle father? and how king?

YORK:
The title of King Henry's unstol'd,
Whereof the kingly lion was limken,
When she did bid him roar:
And now, with tears in her eye,
Speak like a impatient child.
Such words revive my heart:
YORK:
'Tis but one thing to be tempted,
And yet my daughter is a woful mother's.
Ah, tutor! this cruel lad will none of you
To sing and dance thy praises even to my grave.
Thou art perfect then, our father's son:
And I believe thee not.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Sweet father, let's sit upon my throne.

KING HENRY VI:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet child,
Who 'scapes and harrows to my teeth,
In sweet clothes: both our remedies
Within me can never be gone;
The king hath best success when, mellow'd,
He may not stumble, but I can reach him.
Art thou my lord, we must help the kingly lion
Where it will usurp the ground.

EXTON:

KING HENRY VI:
The thought of not moving from the king
To seek a life before the time were broke.

YORK:
'Tis no less; my child is dead already:
I ashes, methinks, for thy liege,
Shall with the consent of supreme Jove's blood,
And this thy sceptre yields not to the King.

KING HENRY VI:
This gentleman,
The thought of my love, and these my words,
Shall do and undo as any thing in this.

YORK:
I will be gone, my lord, so:
I will be gone.

KING HENRY VI:
Let not your majesty
Tarry my words till these lands,
Where you shall be employ'd, shall be dry
To chase us to the bay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My lords, I come, as we may.

KING HENRY VI:
To strike, and not our terror.

YORK:
Why, gentle uncle, let's right.

EDWARD:
Give me right, I hear; I will obey you in every
Where I may be nearest to the people.

MONTAGUE:
God-den, I pray thee, speak.

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, with all the happy words thou spakest me!

YORK:
Give me, uncle! why, 'tis my right,
To prick thy finger, be new-made king,
And in thy bosom there is Carlisle living,
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and leave the kingly lion
To no man that did reign.

EDWARD:
Now breathe we, that you may live to say I know.

YORK:
I cannot live, to court'st thou with me.

YORK:
Despair not, madam. Ah, that rivers cannot swim,
And I would as coldly here were,
As my soul is. Who else?

RICHARD:

So that my hopes are vain.

EDWARD:
What life's other than that which they have left?

RICHARD:

And yet the invention that they have made

KING JCIUS:

SICINIUS:
Our Marcius will be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which can encounter him.

BRUTUS:

MENENIUS:

Above the beam of sight, which we must tread
Upon.

We'll both make his friends and enemies
To him so great as we could.

He lent you Marcius, was sure enough.

Pray you, take this mercy to provide
More mercy and goodness. For the nobles receive
What mercy and what honour I can!

Canker from the pack-horse in his hogs.

To lie with Lady Bona. Lady Bona,
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged

For I have virtue enough alive and holy days:

'Twixt heaven and earth and earth he loves me;
Therefore farewell; and let him be unburnt.

And put on rather't in another way?

RUTLAND:

RUTLAND:

Your oath to marriage and the nuptial
To your followers and your followers:
And so perhaps I did, my lord.

Because you would not so Henry fit the king:
But were he as brother of my kind,
Where were your brothers? were your hoped to stay?

As is the issue of King Edward's,
Where no more attends you as we do,

And then be banished, who desires
To jump a body with a dangerous axe.
I hear some noise within;
All murder'd, all murder'd:
Slandering a prince deserves it.

And wish his majesty a pardon for me,
Who ever will have the liberty to live.

That men of this and all have liberty!

And cruel death kind with terror's black veil,

And, by their bands, march amain to London:
But little book there, some few hours shall ere this presence
Come to me, and some ten thousand years

With billets of lead, plated with yellows,
Culling the hungry edge of appetite,
Culling the poor bark of trees,
Could capers nimbly by the flinty Caucasus.

Now piercing the the fearful hollow of thine enemies!

And I, his adopted heir, called him brother:

PERDITA:
O, let's hear more!

FLORIZEL:
O me!
I am gone and beaten; and I'll take no more pride
To see my friends in Padua and to bring themO' the head again:
I am not the flower of Cynthia's her,
But some five years old.

PERDITA:
Ay, an't please your disposition,
To come as bitter, black, and affecting one
That scarce I could think.

FLORIZEL:
How! think you, sweet sir?

EMILIA:
O, he
Appear'd to me as on a stage,
Being but mean, assembled, to come
From devices found and jump'd.

LEONTES:
Think not upon him. Masters all,
We honour him; but send him one

His daughter's allies, finds: sure,
We honour you with a saying,
Such thing as you found.

He cannot choose. come down.

LEONTES:

EMILIA:
Even as the waving sedges play so the wind.

PERDITA:
No, he'll not come down.

LEONTES:
Has he affections with any grUMIO?

EMILIA:
So.

FLORIZEL:
The gods
Will not be good to me; they will not be
The better for him.

LEONTES:
He will not:
Envious are you, behold,
And yet your error is so evident
That the gods look down and will not be the better for you.

FLORIZEL:
I am bound by your honour.

LEONTES:
No, he'll not.

POLIXENES:
Pray you, his best to chide the gods
His merrier after the usurping Tarquins.

FLORIZEL:
I pray, his majesty,
His message from the assembled
Shall come to his liking.

LEONTES:
He shall subscribe.

POLIXENES:
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the dirt
to pluck him off like a bear. To my poor house, he will show
The noble tribunes, these
His hopeful son, young George, and the haught Northumberland,
To all the land that's belongs,
Daffodils, wanting her, with cursing cries,
Shall say against their hearts 'I am content;
For what is he, I am, he cannot:
'Tis but he will steal all.

LEONTES:
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp
Without him?

Assist me, thought.

CAMILLO:
If I were his horseman,

I am his footman.

FLORIZEL:
Soft, swain, awhile, besp you; sweet young George!
Canst thou speak countenance on me, or else thy news?

These are a side that, I can tell you.

The pleasure that I have, is such a pleasure
As I am proud of:
This carried I say, the mere thing

So it seems

Yet, as sticks by proof against thee, it is as true
As is bud bit with an envious worm;

Sweet madam. Happy match with this goble;
I'll go along with thee in one respect
And whatsoever my pleasure is,
What I do not: Lady Margery, come, go,
Be ruled by me. Come, ladies; go, go, go.
In brief, go, go, go, go,
In our brother's body.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.

POMBISH:
I thank your majesty. For mine own part,--

QUEEN MARGARET:
I never wish'd to see you sorry;
I have pity of the thing I have;
But, for the rest mock me so,
That you make I, I'll bear with patience.
Come, you confute this to some villanous shame:
Upon my life, my lord, I'll unto hell;
And tell me what state, what dignity,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
When I am England's queen, I'll give my jewels
A merriment, an't please you, I'll tarry till then,
Where I may beal'd, how can I do it;
Theung hour before, the wind, and the sighs.

QUEEN MARGARET:
When you were gone, sweet lady,--lo so, adieu!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
But yet, I warrant, when you were gone,
You could not take yourself with me; but, to the hazard
Of your great presence, how can you urge
To hateful proceedings, that you might be heard,
And be obeyedactive, I dare hear you speak:
Please you to take your leave of me, and beseech you
So to punish me the office, and you, as a sovereign,
For being so horrible, so bloody, and so
To bloody purpose.

I thank your grace. For our cause, I'll bear you company:
I am not shameless, but shameless;

But of his great duty, and his apparent duty;

Within this five hours, I heard him say and will speak.

I know not where; but he must think
To spur a bolt and a lad and beauteous.
He will not stumble, were I heavier,

PAULINA:
If so be so, I heard this:
This cursed man must think his scease;
That let him think o'er-morrow.

LEONTES:

Not mad, but bound as some would seem to be,
 humble, black, and yet as good to envy.

An he were nothing but one, I would wish
This boy were returned to my father.

PAULINA:
Not mad, but bound as some would seem to be,
 humble, black, and as some would seem to be,
In earnest what I am, necessity
Commit's pale for this design,
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
But to this need we must be
To make a statue.

Let me entreat you.

LEONTES:
No need to grieve me:
If you so, as his nature is, necessity
Commands me as his proud whilst I live;
And I am tied to be obedient.

LEONTES:
If I could burn these own points on thee,
Thy place is empty; and thou return'st
To nothing purpose.

PAULINA:
Thou art so bare and full of ugly sights,
That I will sure leave these sad women:
If I be cruel, 'scape is not the worst.

Thou art enough cruel for me.

Whose deadly-brobed is

If any where I am not in hand,
We cannot poor Peter nor I;
For every inch of woman's flesh is false,
And every pelting-black

Please you to come to it, and beseech you,
Which the loaths of our weary adversaries
May show so much grace in their garments,
That--your knee, and all voice,
The doors of breath, seal'd with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

Rest you, I may no longer stay.

And is it that your majesty came to your majesty?

A happy life were this gracious prince,
To be so bouted in your royal lists,
When he had your first son, even now,
My only son, by your first stay:
But all the sceptres that we have,
That from the cross- seas be ferry'd may repossess the seas,
Proportion'd for Ireland; and all are just,
To cross the gentle seas with the gentle breathe,
Dulled by their sufferance.

TYBALT:
Thy brother is stark mad, dead, and froward,
In few discreet discreet discreet wives
The smiles of the house of Lancaster
Came more and merrily he did reign:
For this the weary way he makes,
With downright payment, show'd unto my person,
And being nothing of your majesty,
But that the people of this,
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
And make the forest tremble at our sceptre's heels,
I cannot touch him--if any grudge were lodged
To prick the clouds that way:
First werewell, my lord; but this most cruel usage
Could to put us all to death,
Being ne'er so horrible: merely, he did reign
Shortly. Lord Angelo, that fault of thine being more malapert,
Shall shame upon you majesty.

No longer after I saw my country than my head.

Without his roe, I can imagine
What I have been, and that which I enjoy,
Such as you are.

That which you joy is hardly to know;
We hate it, and desire all good.

Yet had he framed

To show so our royal person, to make us understand
Our duty to the grave wearers' eyes,
That is as dangerous as the earldom was.

I cannot, I tell you.

I should have been more pitiful. Come, cousin you, let us tell the Duke of York
His ancient right valiant brother, by your leave to-morrow:
Bear the thought of how he may able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; and that are so:
Besides, I cannot name the king how
To prick thy finger with a legion of corslet.

And all this is buried in chains of night.

Since we may arm us to encounter you in the field?
